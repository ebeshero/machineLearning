# Machine Learning Workshop

Instructors: Paul Barrett and Dave Campbell
Dave is a tool builder

This used to be a week-long class, but they think they can do it in 2 days now.

Lots of English faculty / grad students and 18c / 19c ists here. Some have been working with "pivot tables" and express dissatisfaction with them. 

Tomorrow they start at 10am!

## Saturday:

### Intro / theoretical orientation
"Intelligence Augmentation" (IA) 
Tools that augment intelligence: 
* search engines
* grammar checkers / spell checkers
* facial recognition software

"a web of computation"


Issues: risk assessment social profiling tools that are racially biased

Names associated with race. Computer algorithms match racial biases of those doing ad targetting of profiled communities.

Racial Literacy: breaking free of old patterns: Can we develop tech to resist racist algorithms?
See <https://racialliteracy.tech>

When we design tools, how do we do so that resists existent, entrenched social oppression? 

Wernimont--discussing this: sidewalk labs in Toronto: data collection/monitoring project to provide ways to improve environment/green practices and technologies. 
Critics: this is a form of "surveillance capitalism" to mine individual data for profit.


Eyersâ€™s two critiques: the first laments the loss of humanist sensitivity in the face of technological anonymity" the second notes "the proliferation of positivist methods as another face of the neo-liberalization and corporatization of the university."  

Golumbia, Bruoilette, and Allington: "DH has often tended to be anti-interpretive,...and has played a leading role in the corporatist restructuring of the humanities"

Stanley Fish: "the two attitudes DHers typically strike:
1) we're doing what you've always been doing only we have better ools, and 2) we are the heralds and bearers of a new truth and is is the disruptive challenge of that truth...(loose quote/summary)

Nan Z. Da: critique: what is robust is only what's obvious

Sandra Djwa (1960s): working on a dissertation on Canadian poetry--very marginalized work in the 60s. Got a grant at UVC computer center to make a computer concordance (thousands of punchcards for an IBM mainframe based on corpus of 10 poets). Doing early text mining...started to move changes in literary studies. 

Andrew Piper: Theory gap vs. Evidence gap 

Susan Brown: "minding the gap" between DH experiment work and humanities research questions. 

Tanya Clement: Differential reading: both closely and at a difference

Edward Said: critic as a "network of colliding forces" 

JanMohamed: "Specular border intellectual" --familiar with 2 cultures but unable/unwilling to be "at home" in either  (loose quoting here)

Gallon: black DH promoting system of change 

Wynter: race/class/gender/sex : "differing facets of teh central ethnoclass Man vs. Human"

### Machine Learning in RStudio Cloud
#### or locally on your own machine


Links for getting started:
Software: <https://rstudio.cloud>
Code: <https://github.com/iamdavecampbell/DHSI2019> 

* I have forked to <https://github.com/ebeshero/DHSI2019-1.git> 
* 
Good to work in RStudio to make the work reproducible by others.

Run R in the console. 
You write thing in the Editor (click the double-window button on the side of the terminal) and send them to the Console.

You can copy and paste code from his notes into the terminal.


`.RMD` is R-markdown file extension. You can open these in the Editor.

(in answer to my question):
There's a string-to-integer package in "R" for moving between "forty two" and 42

You have load libraries every time you start R

R markdown code blocks are executable in the console editor. 

`c()` concatenates
