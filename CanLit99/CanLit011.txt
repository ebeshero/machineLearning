A QUARTERLY OF CRITICISM AND REVIEW









REMOTE REFLECTIONS




THis EDITORIAL,  written  far  from  Canada, begins  with  a sub­ ject-Rabindranath  Tagore-which may  well seem  remote   from  the  normal preoccupations of Canadian  Literature. Chance led me to attend during Novem­  ber in  New Delhi  some of the sessions of the literary  seminar held  to celebrate the centenary of  Tagore, who,  like  Gandhi, has  become  the  centre  of  one  of  those reverential cults which  flourish  in independent India.
On  the  whole  what  was said  at  the seminar confirmed  my own  impression  of Tagore as a great  literary-and more  than  literary-personality  rather than  a great   writer. Like  A. E.,  the  poet  of  the  Irish  Renaissance whom  he  resembled in so many  respects,  Tagore came  at  a crucial  time in  the revival  of his country's culture, and, with  his multiform interests  in  poetry  and  drama, in  painting and music,  in education and  philosophy  and  Indian nationalism, he served  a catalytic rather than   a  creative   purpose. Perhaps the  most relevant of all  the  suggestions made  about him  at the seminar was that, by commanding world-wide respect,  he brought about  "the  restoration of  the  self-respect of  the  Indian  intellectual." For,  while  Tagore's writings   may  raise  doubts  in  the  minds  of  critical readers, Tagore as  a symbolic  figure,  standing for  the  revival  of Indian culture after  the long  submersion that  followed  the  decay  of the  Moghul  empire, occupies  a  per­ manently important place  in the literary  history of his country. He  does so largely because  he was so much  more  than  a writer,  because  he was one of the few men in  our  age  to  approach the  great  Renaissance ideal  of the  many-sided  man,  be­ cause  he saw literature never  in isolation  but  always in the  context of  the general  culture of his time,  because  his loyalty  to India and  his loyalty  to the world  were equal yet never  conflicted. In  this respect  it is not inappropriate to compare him

with  men  like Goethe and  Pushkin, who changed the intellectual life of Germany and  Russia,  not  merely  by  what  they  wrote,  but  also by their  personification of the  many-sided urges towards  cultural identity to which  their  times gave birth.
As I have suggested,  all this may appear to have very little  to do with  literature in  Canada. Yet  there  are  similarities between  the  literary   worlds  of  India and Canada. In  both  countries  native  writers  are  adapting the  English  language and English  literary  forms to the lives they live in a world  away from  England. In  both countries the limitations of publishing facilities  make  writing more  often  a labour of dedication than  a profession  by which  the  author can  hope  to attain economic independence.  In   both  countries   writers   are  divided   by  sheer  distance, which makes  the links between  Bombay  and  Calcutta or  Mysore  and  Delhi  as remote  as those  between  Vancouver and  Toronto, and  equally  by linguistic  differences, for while  Canada has two major  literary  languages, India has at least nine.
Yet  there  is  a  certain  unity in  Indian  literary culture, multilingual as it is,
which   unfortunately we  have  not  yet  attained in  Canada. There are  common traditions, a  common   body  of  myth  and   belief,  and,   closer  in  time,  a  shared experience of  the  liberation movement and  of  the  extraordinary, magnetic  per­ sonality   of  Gandhi.  Canada's progression   towards national  autonomy  did  not produce, and   perhaps did  not  need,  a figure  of  Gandhi's moral  power;  it  pro­ duced  instead  the infinitely  more  prosaic  figure  of Sir John A. Macdonald. Simi­ larly,  it did  not  produce a literary  personality of the stature of  Tagore. We have had  writers  whose  work  has  been  as good  as Tagore's, and  even  better, but  we have  had  none  so far  who has so clearly  and  admirably in his own life related  the aims  of literature to  the  realities  of his country and  of  the  world  beyond,  to the external demands of history and to the unhistorical urges of the man  within.
It is  perhaps pointless  to  regret  the  lack,  since  catalytic  personalities can  no more  be produced to order  than  creative  artists.  Yet there  is a point  in remember­ ing,  in our  North  American world,  the  values for  which  Tagore stood.  In  a time when  specialization has narrowed down  literary criticism  to a  technique of analy­  sis and   had  led  to  the  snobbish  cultivation of  "creative"  as  distinct  from  other  forms  of writing, it is well to recollect  those writers  who realised  that  the arts  will atrophy if they  are separated too deeply from  each  other or from  the wider  world in  which  all artists  live. Men  like Tagore have  lessons for other  lands  beside their own.

L-e Canada  fran ais par sa litterature




jean-Charles Falardeau









LTE INTERPRETATION  d'une  littC,.ture, comme  le  '"ppelle Albert  Thibaudet a Ia suite de Montaigne,  est une sorte de discours. Et tout dis­ cours de ce genre est arbitraire. "Parler des lettres, c'est ... les dire en y mettant  un ordre."  Or,  l'histoire  d'une  litterature  ne comporte, de soi, aucun ordre abso­ lument  evident.  On  a  le  choix  entre  plusieurs systemes. Grouper  les ecrivains d'un  pays par  epoques,  par  constellations, par  ecoles, est une operation  selective qui  s'accomplit  a !'aide  de fils conducteurs  que l'historien  ou  le critique  choisit lui-meme  au  depart. Ces fils seront  d'autant plus efficaces qu'on  en aura  trouve Ia suggestion dans  Ia realite Iitteraire  elle-meme, voire dans Ia totalite  de Ia rea­ lite intellectuelle et sociale dont celle-ci a ete le miroir.
II faut eviter, du mains dans un premier regard, de trap  comparer  Ia litterature du Canada fran  ais
ment,  comme  Ia Iitterature franc;aise, soit geographiquement, comme  les Iittera­ tures canadienne, anglaise ou americaine. Elle n'est pas une litterature comme les autres.  Elle  est  meme  beaucoup  mains  une litterature que  ne le  sont  plusieurs litteratures   "nationales". On  s'est  longtemps  demande  si elle  existait  vraiment.  Reconnaissons  que oui, elle existe. Reconnaissons aussitot que Ia critique  qui s'est complue  a !'analyser  est generalement demeuree en dec;a des evaluations  propre­ ment  esthetiques.  La critique  canadienne-franc;aise a ete essentiellement  une cri­ tique  morale,  ou  theologique,  ou sociologique, ou  psychologique.  II en est ainsi parce que !'ensemble  de Ia litterature canadienne est surtout  interessante  dans ces perspectives-Ia. Rares  sont les tres grandes reuvres poetiques ou romanesques  qui s'imposent  par leur eclat ou par leur grandeur. La litterature a ete avant  tout un

instrument  de  combat social  ou  politique,  un  refuge,   une  soupape  de  surete. Rendre compte de la litterature canadienne-franc;;aise c'est, dans  une large  mesure, recapituler l'aventure de la collectivite  humaine dont  elle a ete un cri ou un reflet.
"Nous sommes  en  presence," ecrit  le  critique Gilles  Marcotte, "a la  fois  d'un
milieu  et  d'une litterature qui  se font.  Et  nous  venons  a  peine  d'apercevoir les lignes de force qui commandent I'evolution de l'un  et de I'autre."'
L'image que  les Canadiens franc;;ais se font  de leur  histoire  est condensee dans un  double  souvenir: celui  de 1'  "age  d'or" du  regime  franc;;ais; celui  de  la  de­ possession  du  regime  anglais.  Ces deux  souvenirs sont  distincts  l'un  de l'autre. Ils sont  la  cause  d'un profond   dechirement. La  rupture  de  }'association avec  la France, en  I 76o,  a pris retrospectivement surtout depuis l'historien F.-X  Garneau au  milieu  de XIX• siecle, le caractere d'un traumatisme. Les generations de Cana­ diens  ont  vu  leur  histoire  scindee  en  deux  tronc;;ons.  Ils  se sont  vus eux-memes comme   des  exiles.  Jusqu'a une  epoque recente,  leur societe a  ete  une  sorte d'Irlande: culturellement insulaire  dans  un  continent anglophone, politiquement minoritaire, baignant  dans  une  atmosphere  de  constant "etat de  siege",  repliee sur  elle-meme, frustree. Au  surplus,  cette  societe  est  maintenant passee de  l'etat traditionnel et  rural   au stade  industriel et  urbain. D'homogene, elle est devenue  culturellement  heterogene. Les classes  sociales  se sont  diversifiees.  Les  attitudes, les  modes  de  vie,  les comportements  se sont  alteres.  L'univers social  canadien­ franc;;ais, depuis  la premiere guerre mondiale, est passe de l'age  de Maria Chapde­
laine  a celui  de  Babitt.  A  l'eclatement des  structures sociales  traditionnelles a
correspondu une rejuvenation de la creation litteraire et artistique. Le Canada franc;;ais contemporain offre l'image d'une societe  en quete  d'une nouvelle defini­
tion d'elle-meme et d'un  sens nouveau a donner a sa culture.




QUELLES SONT,  dans l'histoire  sociale canadienne,  les phases  distinctives, et, par  rapport a celles-ci, les epoques  marquantes de l'histoire litteraire? Peut-on, avec l'ecrivain Roger  Lemelin, discerner  trois etapes  de }'evo­ lution   sociale: la  vie  rurale, la  vie  urbaine, la  vie  nord-americaine,  auxquelles correspondraient  trois registres  d'expression litteraire:  pastoral,  urbain,  psycholo­ gique?C'est  beaucoup simplifier.  Ou  doit-on, comme   le  fait  Gerard Tougas, reconnaitre cinq  generations litteraires caracteristiques:  les debuts; I'age de Gar­ neau  ( I 845- I 865)  ; un age de transition ( 1865- I 899)  ; I'epoque moderne ( I 900- I939)  et  l'epoque  comtemporaine?3  Ce  schema  se  justifie  par  plusieurs  criteres

valables  mais  il manque le fait  que  deux  genres importants au  mains,  le roman et  Ia  poesie,  ont  connu  des  tempos  d'evolution fort  differents l'un  de l'autre. Ce qu'il  faut  surtout demander a l'histoire, c'est }'indication des conditions qui  ont favorise  certains climats  intellectuels, certains  genres  d'expression litteraire,  cer­ tains  themes   ou  certaines obsessions.  La  litterature  canadienne  recele  quelques archetypes tenaces.  Plus  que  toute  autre  source,  elle permet  d'identifier  certains grands mythes  qui,  de fac;on inconsciente ou consciente, ont polarise  les ambitions, les illusions ou les frustrations de Ia collectivite.
Notre  litterature fut  d'abord une rhetorique. Cette  rhetorique etait  nourrie des
encyclopedistes  du  XVIIIe siecle  et  du   romantisme politique.  Mais  apres  Ia revolte  manquee de  1837,  le lyrisme  qu'avaient provoque Ia parole  et Ia  person­ nalite   de  Papineau se  trouva vide  de  son  ambition. A  partir de  cette  epoque, comme  le note  Victor  Barbeau, Ia notion  meme  de patrie sera  devenue,  pour  les ecrivains canadiens, une abstraction.4  Les lenteurs  et les incertitudes initiales  de Ia litterature  refletere:1t  cette   immense deception.  Ses  premiers  devoloppements furent assez semblables a ceux  de Ia litterature americaine de l'epoque. Elle com­ menc;a a  se depolitiser par  l'histoire et  par  Ia poesie.  L'interet historique suscite
par   Garneau fut  a l'origine de  Ia  premiere grande  aventure poetique, celle de
I'Ecole   patriotique  de  Quebec,  de I 86o.  Cremazie,  Frechette,  embouchent  Ia trompette de  La  Legende  des siecles. Leurs  grandiloquentes envolees  orchestrent ausi  le  sentiment d'un  exil,  d'une separation d'avec Ia  vie.  Le  leur  cote,  les premiers romans ont  un  interet purement documentaire. Le  Charles  Guerin  de Chauveau decrit  les culs-de-sac  de Ia societe, Ia pathetique trilogie  des seules pro­ fessions-pretrise, droit,   medecine-offertes au  jeune  Canadien  franc;ais,  l'af­
folante distance qui  separe ceux  qui  s'adonnent a ces professions  du  reste  de  Ia
societe.  Gerin-Lajoie propose  a !'admiration et a !'imitation de ses compatriotes
un  heros,   jean  Rivard, dont  Ia raison  de vivre  est formulee par  un  traite d'eco­
nomie  politique et agricole.
Cette  litterature est deja  abstraite. L'ecrivain canadien-franc_;ais, intellectualise, moralisant, construit  des  theses  et  des  modeles  a imiter. On  sent  que,  tout  en simulant de  s'adresser a l'ensemble de  ses compatroites, il  n'ecrit, en  fait,  que
pour I'elite restreinte qui  partage sa formation et son mode  de pensee. Son inspira­ tion  est coupee  de Ia litterature populaire et du folklore.  Seul, Philippe-Aubert de Gaspe,  dans  Les Anciens Canadiens, tente  de reconstituer des scenes de vie popu­ laire  dans  un  milieu  connu, encore  que  celui-ci  soit  un  manoir seigneurial. La litterature orale   du   Canada franc;ais  etait   pourtant  d'une  inepuisable richesse. Cycles  de  contes,  Iegendes,   chansons,  apportes  d'Europe ou  inventes  sur  place,

avaient ete  propages par les voyageurs,  les coureurs des bois, les hommes  de peine et  les gens de  metier. 11s se perpetuaient dans  la campagne canadienne, animant la  vie de  famille  et  de voisinage  dont  ils constituaient la  mythologie familiere et les  occasions  d'enchantement. Or,  sauf  de  tres  rares  exceptions, les reuvres  lit­ teraires  sont  demeurees etrangeres a ces formes  traditionnelles d'invention  artisti­ que,  a leurs  heros,  a leurs themes,  a leur style. 11 existe, entre  la litterature ecrite et la litterature orale,  un divorce  complet.
On   retrouve un  divorce  identique entre la  litterature et  la  geographic. La
nature canadienne, est-il besoin dele rappeler, est tour  a tour exaltante et brutale. L'immensite de ses espaces, la desolante monotonic de ses forets,  la rigueur de ses interminables hivers, lui donnent un caractere souvent hostile. Ellene se conquiert pas  aisement. Elle  est  infiniment lente  a  humaniser. Elle  cree  la  solitude. Elle provoque l'opiniatrete  ou  le  desespoir. Elle  engendre  difficilement la  serenite. L'homme canadien l'a  cependant possedee  au  prix  de  titanesques efforts. 11 s'est epuise ala  dominer, ala harnacher, a se l'assujettir.
En  consequence, l'ecrivain canadien a aussi  traite cette  nature comme  la pro­
tagoniste d'un  incessant   duel  plutot   que  comme   un  etre  auquel on  cherche a s'accorder ou  dont   on  ambitionne de  comprendre la  physionomie particuliere. Les  reuvres  descriptives, certes,  ne  manq uent  pas, mais elles  demeurent,  en general, prisonnieres d'un  facile  lyrisme  regionaliste qui  s'exprime en  formules stereotypees. A  !'exception  de  quelques reuvres  recentes   de  Ringuet, de  Felix­ Antoine Savard, de  Robert Choquette, les rares  ouvrages dans  lesquels la  nature joue  un  role important, tels Un  homme  se penche sur son  passe de  Constantin­ Weyer  ou  Maria  Chapdelaine  de  Louis  Hernon, sont  d'ecrivains franc;ais  ayant  sejourne au  Canada. Pour  l'ecrivain canadien, la  nature se  ramene ala "terre", c'est-a-dire une  reuvre  a  accomplir   et  des  vertus  a  pratiquer. La  "terre" de  la
litterature  canadienne-franc;aise s'oppose  a la ville, laquelle est le lieu de !'illusion,
de  l'oisivete,  des  decheances. La  terre  est le lieu  de  la  pratique des vertus  fortes

grace  auxquelles la nation  a du  de survivre  et devra  son salut  a venir.  Mais cette terre  est  davantage la  terre  a conquerir et  a  defricher que  la  terre  conquise et
possedee. Elle est un appel  vers un agrandissement constant, c'est-a-dire vers la penetration de ce qui  l'entoure immediatement, de  ce qui  l'empeche d'etre com­ pletement elle-meme, de ce dont  l'homme tire  deja  une  partie  de sa fruste subsi­ stance:  la  foret.   Les  qualites et  les  attributs du  heros  de  romans  terriens   au Canada sont,  en  fait,  les qualites et les attributs de  l'homme de la  foret  sous ses multiples avatars:  chasseur,  trappeur, bucheron, voyageur. Le  vrai  mythe  n'est pas  tant   celui  de  la  terre  que  celui  des  grands espaces  qui  attendent l'homme

dans  "les  pays  d'en-haut". Le  "nord" des  romans  canadiens, tel que  recree  par

!'imagination, est  plus  qu'un espace  geographique.  C'est  un  symbole   magique dont  les significations ambigues s'entremelent et se confondent. Ce  "nord" est  a
la  fois  l'apre  territoire ou  il  faut aller enfoncer la  charrue; il est  l'appel vers l'inconnu; il est  eminemment le lieu de I'evasion, de  la fuite  de la societe,  de  la poursuite des  aventures et  des chimeres. Ce  besoin  d'evasion vers  le nord  se  re­ trouve,  soit  camoufle, soit  exprime  avec  une  douloureuse ironie,  meme  dans  de toutes  recentes  ceuvres inspirees  par  la vie urbaine canadienne, tel  le  Alexandre Chenevert  de Gabrielle Roy.  L'ecrivain canadien-franc;ais a decrit  la terre  comme  lieu d'enracinement obstine: ill'a celebree  pour des raisons morales ou politiques; il a  perc;u sa  valeur  de  refuge.  Dans  tous les cas, elle est objet  d'une dechirante option  plutot  que d'une fecondante communion.
Comment expliquer ce double  divorce?  Par  le formalisme d'un  enseignement centre  sur  la rhetorique et sur  une philosophie  exsangue?  Parle  formalisme d'une religion  d'allure m::micheenne?  Quoi  qu'il  en soit, ce divorce  est lui-meme grande­ ment   responsable d'une  faiblesse  radicale de  la  litterature  canadienne:  la  pau­ vrete  d'expression. Inutile  de  reprendre ici  ce  proces  ni  l'inventaire des  causes
qu'on  a  attribuees a  ce  phenomene. Il  est  indeniable que  l'une des  plus  im­
portantes parmi ces causes  a ete l'eloignement de la France et le caractere spora­
dique  de  l'osmose  canadienne avec  cette  source  necessaire.  Au fait,  la realite  n'a pas ete tout  a fait  aussi simple.  Il y a eu, selon les epoques  et les ecoles de pensee, soit  une  volonte  deliberee de  se soumettre a !'influence fecondante de la France, soit  une  volonte  egalement categorique de se soustraire a cette  tutelle  et  de s'en
tenir  aux  seules  inspirations locales. La  vie litteraire canadienne a ete faite  d'une alternance entre   ces  deux   ambitions. On   pourrait ecrire   une  histoire   de  cette litterature en suivant les mouvements de son oscillation  entre  ces deux  poles.
Un  des moments fascinants de cette dialectique a ete celui de !'Ecole litteraire
de  Montreal, au  tournant du  siecle. Cette  Ecole, qui  en fut  a peine  une,  favorisa la  rencontre  des  ecrivains les  plus  resolus  qu'ait  produits le  Canada   franc;ais.
Poetes  ou  prosateurs, tous  esthetes,  ils rivaliserent   de  talent   pour   affranchir  les lettres  canadiennes. Les Soirees du Chateau  Ramezay, la revue  Le Nigog, temoi­ gnent  de  cette  renaissance. Sans  renier !'inspiration  nationale, ils proclamaient la necessite  pour  l'ecrivain de  "la  liberte  des  sujets"  et  de  "la  communion de  nos
lettres  a la  civilisation franc;aise"5. Le plus remarquable de leurs  porte-parole fut
Emile  Nelligan, un  poete  d'ascendance irlandaise. Se reclamant du  Parnasse ou du symbolisme, les poetes de cette generation abandonnent les themes  patriotiques et  les  preoccupations  purement  indigenes pour  dire  la  beaute des  choses  ou  la

variete   de  leurs  emotions   souvent   raffinees.  Apres  eux,  des  courants  pourtant issus de la meme source  deriveront en sens contraire pour  se complaire de nouveau dans  le  regionalisme. La  poesie  canadienne, apres  un  moment d'eclat, allait  se retracter dans les simples satisfactions du terroir.



LE ROMAN QUI,   durant cette  periode, etait  demeure un genre peu  ou  mal  cultive  devait  passer  a son tour  par  de  rapides phases  d'evolution. 11
se  rapprocha davantage de  la  realite,  une  realite  qui  pendant un  long  moment demeura celle  de la  vie des ancetres   (Robert de  Roquebrune) ou  de  la vie  ter­ rienne   ( Ringuet, Grigon, Guevremont). Mais  deja,  les stereotypes sentimentaux de  jadis  ont  fait  place  a  une  observation plus  aigue.  Le romancier  est sensible  a la  misere  humaine. La litterature atteint un stade  sociologique et, avec Gabrielle Roy  et Roger  Lemelin,  annexera soudain  a son champ de vision, dans  les annees  r 940,  les drames  et  les peripeties  de  la  vie urbaine. Quelques  autres romanciers
s'etaient  engages   dans   le  recit   psychologique (Harvey,  Desmarchais).  Bientot celui-ci  sera  la  grande avenue  du  roman   (Charbonneau, Elie,  Giroux). La  lit­ terature qui,  jusque-la,  etait  une  prise de conscience  de  la societe  deviendra  une plongee  en  profondeur dans  le dramatique univers  interieur des individus.
J'ai compare le  Canada fran<;ais a  l'Irlande. Ce  parallele vaut  aussi  pour  les litteratures des deux  societes, mais  d'une fa<;on partielle. Beaucoup d'ecrivains irlandais, Joyce  en fut  le cas le plus fulgurant, ont  du s'exiler  de leur  milieu  pour creer   leurs   ruvres  artistiques, transportant  au   plus  profond  d'eux-memes, ou qu'ils fussent,  la  totalite   de  leur  Irishness. Les  ecrivains  canadiens-fran<;ais, en general, n'ont  pas eu a quitter leur  milieu. Jusqu'a ces derniers temps  cependant, celui-ci  les a gardes  semblables  a lui-meme,  paralysant leurs  moyens  d'expression.
Dans  une  penetrante these  presentee  a la  Faculte des  Lettres de  Montreal, en
1953,  une  jeune critique, Monique Bosco, affirmait que le grand theme  du roman canadien  est  celui  de  l'isolement.6 L'auteur  parlait  de  l'isolement de  l'ecrivain dans  son  milieu  mais  surtout de  l'isolement des personnages de roman. On  peut dire  des  heros  de  romans  canadiens-fran<;ais, adolescents ou  adultes, hommes  ou femmes, ce qu'on a dit  des Gens de Dublin  de Joyce: ce sont  des etres  traques. Ils vivent  de sentiments de culpabilite, de remords, d'angoisses. Leur  psychologie est une  psychologie  de confessional.  Leur  existence  est une  tentative de liberation, generalement infructueuse, et leur  echec  s'exprime par  !'invective ou la condam­ nation. Ce  dont  ils cherchent a s'evader, c'est  une societe  dont  le  reseau  de rela-

tions sociales,  de  tabous et  de sanctions  est si serre que  l'individu s'y sent  pris au piege. Beaucoup des heros  de ces romans sont desabuses  avant d'avoir vecu. Leurs actes sont  des actes  manques. Leur  vie sera  manquee. Prisonniers de la lettre  des prescriptions  morales  sans  etre  religieux,  ils n'ont  que  les incertitudes du  doute sans  les  joies de  !'esperance. Incapables d'assumer leur  condition humaine avec ses grandeurs et ses miseres, ils vivent  replies sur eux-memes. Ils se revelent  inaptes
a communiquer avec  autrui. Les plus belles pages de certains romans recents,  tel
La Fin des Songes  de Robert Elie, sont des pages de journal. Effare ou impuissant devant le silence des autres et le sien, le heros canadien-fran<_;ais de roman ne peut reellement communiquer  qu'avec  lui-meme.   L'introspection  du   journal intime est le substitut de !'impossible echange  avec autrui. Ce n'est  pas par  hasard qu'une des ceuvres les plus impressionnantes de notre  litterature soit le  journal  de Saint­
Denys  Garneau. Par  ce  biais,  le roman  canadien-fran<_;ais illustre  a sa fa<_;on  un
trait   general de  la  litterature  contemporaine: I'importance accordee au  mono­
logue interieur dramatise l'echec  de la communion entre  les hommes.
Inutile de  preciser  que  tres  peu  d'ceuvres  reftetent  l'amour de  la  vie. Une  des rares  exceptions est  celle  de  Roger  Lemelin  chez  les personnages duquel  triom­ phent  l'action, le besoin  de vivre, !'ambition conquerante, le desir  du  succes. Ses
heros  tiennent a la fois d'un Rastignac et d'un Julien  Sorel  que  l'on  aurait trans­
plantes dans  l'univers  nord-americain  nai:f et  dynamique ou  se  mouvaient, au debut   du  siecle,  les personnages d'Horatio Algier.  Un  ecrivain-clown comme Fran<_;ois  Hertel ne  nous  laisse pas  dupes: ses dialogues  humoristiques, ses  acro­ baties  verbales  et ses scolaires  ambitions de scandale ne  traduisent, en  definitive,
que !'impuissance a assumer  un risque autre  que celui de I'adolescence. Non seule­
ment   l'amour de  la  vie  est  absent  des  romans  et  du  theatre, mais  l'amour  lui­ meme.  "Il n'y  a  pas," affirmait Monique Bosco, "de  vrais  romans  d'amour  au Canada; il  n'y  a  que  des  romans  ou  l'on  voudrait aimer."  L'homme est moins
apte  a communiquer avec  la  femme  qu'avec quiconque. Il  eprouve devant elle
veneration ou  respect.  Elle est litteralement l'objet  d'un culte.  Elle est inaccessible et,  en  definitive, elle  est objet  de  crainte. La  litterature canadienne a maternise l'image de  la  femme. Qu'il s'agisse  des romans  de Gabrielle Roy  ou  de  Lemelin
lui-meme, la presence  enveloppante par rapport a laquelle les etres definissent  leur
ideal,  leurs  normes   de  vie,  leur  securite,  est  celle de  la  mere.  A  travers  elle, la famille   prend   sons  sens.  Elle  incarne les souvenirs  d'enfance, la  nostalgie  d'une
beatitude, la  saturation de  tous  les reves. Elle est l'idole- a travers laquelle  on
pense  aussi  la  religion  et  la  patrie-qui  continue   a fasciner  I'adolescent  et  a
troubler l'homme adulte. Les autres  femmes,  a cote d'elle,  ne  pourront etre  que

dangereuses. Le  jeune  homme  ideal  est !'enfant qui  repondra aux  voeux  de  sa mere.  L'adolescent modele sera un etre feminise.

eclate   d'une autre   fac;on. L'action de  plusieurs   reuvres,  au  theatre ou  dans  le roman, se  passe  a  l'hopital, a  Ia creche  ou  a  l'orphelinat. Ce  sont  Ia,  bien  sur, des  lieux  de  caractere pathetique, propres  a  servir  de  cadres a  de  douloureuses aventures humaines. Mais en elisant  si frequemment ces institutions, les ecrivains n'y  ont-ils  pas  vu  avec  une  troublante intuition des lieux  representatifs de !'en­ semble  de  leur  societe?  C'est-a-dire, un  milieu  humain ou, comme  a Ia  creche  et a l'orphelinat, l'individu est entoure d'une providence enveloppante et inflexible; ou,  comme  a l'hopital, il doit  abdiquer, entre  les mains  de  techniciens-magiciens, les decisions  dont  depend !'orientation de son destin.  Dans les trois cas, I'individu est  entoure et  pris  en  main  par  les autres.  Dans  les trois  cas, il est vecu  plutot  qu'il   ne  vit.  La  ranc;on  de  Ia surprotection et  de  l'inquietante securite   dont  il jouit  est !'alienation de sa  propre  liberte.  L'homme  n'est  sauve  que  s'il  consent  a etre soumis.
On   est  en  plein cercle vicieux. Mais au  fur et  a  mesure que Ia  societe canadienne-franc;aise se diversifie  et  se  pluralise et  que le  climat   humain  des villes  devient anonyme et  anomique, Ia litterature  commence a  reHeter  le  rela­ chement du  reseau   des  contraintes qui  retenaient Ies individus. Dans  quelques romans d'il  y a  quinze  ou  vingt  ans,  des  personnages avaient eu  !'intention ou le desir  du  suicide.  Pour  Ia premiere  fois, celui-ci  est effectivement  commis  dans  L'Evade  de la nuit  d'Andre Langevin, qui  est  de  1954.  Le  tissu  moral  n'a  plus Ia resistance  suffisante  pour  maintenir l'individu dans  l'axe  de ses relations tradi­ tionnelles avec  l'au-dela, avec Ia vie, avec Ia societe.  Le  jean Cherteffe  de Lange­ vin nous est temoin  que dorenavant, l'homme canadien-franc;ais formule le drame de  son  existence   dans  ses termes  personnels, en  dec;a ou  au-dela des  normes  anciennes.
Cette   quete   individuelle de  valeurs  nouvelles,   on  Ia  trouve   surtout  formulee dans  I'reuvre  des  poetes.  Depuis  plus de vingt  ans,  avec  Alain  Grandbois,  Saint­ Denys  Garneau et,  maintenant, une  constellation de  jeunes  ecrivains  de  grand talent, Ia  poesie  au  Canada franc;ais a  atteint une  authenticite en  meme  temps qu'une qualite de forme  qui l'apparentent aux  grands courants universels contem­ porains. Le  poete canadien s'est  evade,   une  fois  pour  toutes,  de  !'arsenal des themes   regionalistes  et  patriotiques.  II  s'est  tourne  vers  lui-meme  en  tant   qu'  homme. Cet  homme cherche et s'interroge, s'inquiete et s'insurge. Comme Lazare, il est ressuscite, il veut marcher, mais on le sent encore depayse: depayse  devant Ie

NOTHING SACRED
Humour in Canadian drama in English



William Solly







IT MAY   WELL  BE   that  the d'ama is the  most difficult litemy
form  to  master,  but  in  Canada it is certainly  not  for  this  reason  alone  that  one
finds  it  to  be  the  least  practised  of all  the  arts.  Plays  do  not  exist  without  pro­ ductions and   audiences to  watch   them,  and   though it  is  by  now  a  well-worn  excuse  for  the  anremic  state  of our  theatre to say  that  our  audiences  have  been lured  elsewhere,  it  is nevertheless  quite  true  that  prolonged exposure to  the skills of  Broadway and  American films has  given  rise to  a  widespread  conviction on the  part  of  Canadians that their drama will  not  only  be  inferior but,  worse, amateur. There are  other  reasons, of course: the  size of the country, the scarcity  of  theatres, and  the  high  costs of production make  it next  to impossible  for  any theatrical venture to  tour  Canada; in  more  recent  years  there  is the  blow  that  television   has  dealt   the  theatre-crippling  enough  everywhere else,  but  in Canada all  but  mortal (except  in  so far  as it  has encouraged  playwrights of its own)  ; and,  finally,  can  we  not  with  justification  blame   the  very  temper of the country?-is  there   not  a  certain   national lack  of  self-confidence, pride,  and  romance which  has refused to allow our drama to develop?
Whatever the reasons,  Canadian playwrights are in a difficult situation. Serious drama is barely  tolerated, and  hence usually not written. One  comes with surprise upon  something like  Merrill  Denison's  Marsh  Hay,  which  is  a  quite   reputable play admirably sustaining tense drama for four  acts-but one is not too surprised never  to  have  heard   of its  being  produced. As if aware of  this  situation, Lister Sinclair's Return  to Colonus, a relatively esoteric  drama, never  had  any commer­ cial  aspirations to  begin  with.  The  same  author's The  Blood is  Strong  might  at

first appear to be the  exception: it is a moving  story about  early settlers  in Cape Breton  Island   which  has  en joyed a considerable success on stage,  radio  and  tele­ vision.  But  integral to  its  success  and  what  no  doubt   first  helped  to  attract its Canadian audiences is the  fact  that  it contains  a good  deal  of  humour. Humour occupies   an  important  place  in  Canadian drama in  English  and   most  of  our plays-and nearly  all of our  best plays-rely heavily  upon  it. Our  best drama­ tist,  for  instance-Robertson Davies-works exclusively  in  comedy. Whatever the  reason   behind   this  preoccupation with  the  comic-whether it  is that  our audiences are  especially  prone  to laughter, or  that the  Canadian situation is such an  absurd  one  that  our  treatments of it cannot  be wholly serious-its results are of a sufficient  quality (and quantity)  to  bear  examination, and  they  might  even be expected to throw  on  the  Canadian character their  own special  share  of light.
According to the various  ways that  humour is employed  in them,  our  plays may be  roughly   divided   into  three  groups.  The  first  is chiefly  a  satirical one  where plays invariably deal  with  distinctly  Canadian subject  matter: it is popular, often commercially successful  and  generally  too  busy making  fun  of national problems to prescribe  remedies for them.  At the opposite  end of the humour spectrum there lies another kind  of satirical drama, which  will be considered last  here: its sub­ ject  matter is  again  invariably Canadian  but  the  humourous treatment  differs, frequently taking  the  form  of skilled sugar-coating for a didactic and often  bitter  pill.  (Surprisingly enough, however,  this dubious technique usually  results  in  the best  drama  that   Canada  produces.)  Between  these  two  comic  frontiers lies  a middle   area, a  proportionately  vast  field  of  relatively  gentle  comedy,   most  of which  is so  dull  and   undistinguished as  truly  to  merit   this  prairie   description. Characters,  themes,   and   settings  for  these  plays  are,  in  contrast to  the  above,  frequently of an  ambiguous nationality, and  the  entire field  may  be said  to owe its existence  to  the  number of one-act  play  festivals  and  competitions which  dot the  Dominion and   which  explain   why  so  much  Canadian drama in  general is cast in the one-act play form.




ROUT      the  most consistently  rewarding period  of Canadian  playwriting took  place  some  years  ago  during the  heyday  of  C.B.C. Radio when  Canada had  a radio  drama of unique  excellence  and  a whole  roster of impressive  playwrights: Lister Sinclair, Len Peterson,  Tommy Tweed, Andrew Allan,   Mavor  Moore, Bernard Braden, Joseph  Schull  and  Fletcher Markle, to

NOTHING  SACRED



name  only a few. It is to these that  we must  look for some of the best of all three types of comedy  outlined  above, but especially for that  of the first type, the rollick­ ing irreverent satire  which  may be good-natured but  is not  in the  least interested in  being   constructive. Unfortunately,  few  of  these  radio   plays  have  yet  been published, nor  are  copies  of  them  available to  me,  and   memory  alone  cannot hope  to  indicate the  way so many  of  them  employed this  kind  of  humour (the  way it was used, for example, in Tommy Tweed's The  Man  from Number  ro­ a satire  on Canada's apathy and  lack of allure  as seen through the eyes of a New­ foundlander whose  country   has  newly  joined  the  Dominion) . Of  the  few  radio  plays of this  type  which  have  been  published,  however,  one  at  least is a splendid specimen and  it will serve to give a closer look here  at the nature of this first kind of humour: it is Lister Sinclair's We  All Hate Toronto:
NARRATOR:   Once  upon  a  time  there  lived a young  man  called  Charlie.  Most of the  time, he was a very ordinary  young man  who did  very ordinary  things, but one day he made a dreadful  decision:
CHARLIE:  I am the master of my fate; I am the captain  of my soul. NARRATOR:  He called for his poor, old, leather-faced father: CHARLIE: Father,  dear father, I have something to tell you. NARRATOR:  And he sent for his poor, old, wire-haired  mother: CHARLIE: Dearest mamma, I have something to tell you, too. NARRATOR:  And he told them both his dreadful  decision:
CHARLIE:  I have decided to go to Toronto.
MOTHER AND FATHER:   (A dreadful  shriek apiece)  ! ! ! !•

The innocent is informed that  everybody  hates Toronto, especially  those who have never  been  there.   When   he  is fitted  out  for  the   journey and  for  the  Toronto weather ("Many are  cold  but  few are  frozen"), he is also told  about  the  people who actually do live there:

As is well-known, few indeed  are the people who are  true-blue,  copper-bottomed, aged-in-wood,  natives of Toronto.  There  are  six hundred  thousand  people living there, but they're all from out of town.

Charlie persists,  however,  and   rrives
in  the  vast  deserted   canyons  of  Union   Station, and   when  he  ventures outside, turning "up Yonge  Street,  stretching away  straight as  an  arrow   (and about   as wide)   all  the  way  up  to  Hudson Bay,  the  Arctic   Circle  and   North York", he meets a girl:

•   A  Play  on  Words and  other  Radio  Plays  (Toronto  Dent,  I948)  contains  all the
Sinclair radio plays quoted from in this article. 	'

NOTHING SACRED



There  she was sitting  on the  curb  in King Street  with  the  tallest  building in the British  Empire   right  behind  her,  and  the  largest hotel  in  the  British  Empire  a couple  of blocks away, and  the dullest Sunday in the British Empire  going on all around  her.

The  girl  tells him  that  there  are  thousands of pairs  of eyes watching them  from behind  closed blind5 :
CHARLIE:  I thought  people only did that in small towns.
JULIA: Toronto is the largest small town in the British Empire.

Finally,   after   a  number  of  depressing   experiences,  Charlie meets  a  tramp  m
Queen's Park  who sets his mind  at rest:

MAN: Toronto  is the greatest unifying influence in this country  today ...
CHARLIE: But we all hate Toronto.
MAN:   That's just it.  We all  hate  Toronto!  It's  the only thing  everybody's got in common. You hear  a dreadful  quarrel start up between English, Canadians, and French  Canadians, or  Maritimers  and  Manitobans,  or  some  such  thing.  Just when  they're  going  to  cut  each  others'  throats,  somebody  mentions  Toronto. And  what  happens?  ... As soon as anybody mentions  Toronto, all enmity  is forgotten,  all scars are healed, all thoughts of violence and discord are swallowed up in  warm  brotherly  love, and  united  at last in friendship,  the erstwhile rival disputants  can  weep  joyfully on one another's  shoulders, as in a sublime chorus they lift up their  voices in abominable  vilification of Toronto, the Queen  City! Long may she continue  to rot!
I have  quoted at  such  length   from  Sinclair's play  because  it  draws  attention to a number of features typical  of this first class of dramatic humour whose free­ wheeling   spirit  has  confronted the  indifference of the  Canadian  public,  proved irresistible  and  earned itself a popular success. The  first and  most  obvious feature is the  Canadian institution or  presumably sacred  cow  under fire. Another is the innocent hero  or  heroine  through whose eyes the satire  is experienced: our  play­ wrights  seem  especially  fond  of this  device  of  introducing Canada to  this inter­ ested  and   usually  virtuous novice.  It might  also be  worth noting   here  that  the innocent does not  attempt to escape: no matter how disillusioning the  revelations afforded him  about Canada may  be, he invariably manages to extract some value from  them  and  remain.
In  Sinclair's play  two  other   typical  features  are  noticeable by  their  absence. One  of these is a distressing  one and  his play is well-rid  of it: this is that  curious partiality for  imitation which  lends  a hybrid  and  hence  not  very original quality to  a good  deal  of this  kind  of satire.  As early  as  I 87 4 it appears in such  a work as  William  H.  Fuller's The  Unspecific  Scandal, a political  spoof  whose  humour

NOTHING  SACRED



relies largely  (and  shakily)  upon  reworkings  of  well-known  lines from  Shake­ speare  and  in  new  lyrics for such  old songs as  "Scots  Wha  Hae",  "After  the Ball",  and  "Yankee  Doodle  Dandy".  Later  the  same  author  presented  H.M.S. Parliament  ( 188o), a  rather   amateurish   reworking  of   Gilbert  and  Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore  which, in its labour  to  recast  Gilbert's lyrics and  libretto  in a Canadian political setting, all but loses whatever  satirical intentions  it originally had  of its own.  Affection for  this kind  of imitation   in  the  drama  is still  (and lamentably) very much with us today.
The  other  feature  of Sinclair's  play which  may  not  be typical  of the class in
which  I place it is the fact that its satirical  barbs, bold though  they may seem to be, are not nearly outrageous enough. His satire here is, in essence, double-edged: that  is, while it  joins with its audience  to laugh  at  an institution  made  to look ridiculous,  at the same time it laughs also at the very people with whom it seems to side. This  may well make it a superior  piece of satire  but such a technique  is not,  I think,  typical  of its class-which is usually so disrespectful  that Sinclair's play seems timid by comparison.
I  am  speaking  largely  of  revue,  a  dramatic institution   which  flourishes  in
Canada, and  which is also a fairly recent phenomenon. Thirty-five  years ago, in fact,  Vincent  Massey noted  a total  absence of such farce  in  Canadian theatre: "Is  this by accident," he asked, "or  are we, after  all, a serious-even a solemn folk?"  But  today  we have the  unbridled,  even at  times sensational,  revue satire of Toronto's annual  Spring  Thaw, Montreal's  intimate club shows, sketches by writers  like Eric  Nicol, Pierre Berton  and  Mavor  Moore,  and  even some of the comedy of Wayne and Schuster on the C.B.C. Although  once again  unpublished
-perhaps because much of it is only topical for its time and dates quickly-this
kind of writing  nevertheless displays extraordinary range  and  vitality, and seems to consider nothing too sacred to be laughed at.
At its best this kind of Canadian comedy has about  it a self-consciously wicked quality  that  one might well term undergraduate, albeit  a kind of undergraduate humour   displaying  unusual  strength.  And  so it is not  surprising  that  the  most successful comedy  of this type should  have  been  a  college show,  McGill's  Red and  White Revue of 1957, My  Fur Lady. Here we may find embodied once again all  the  features  outlined  above.  To  begin  with,  there  is the  innocent  to whom Canada is introduced-an Eskimo princess who must seek a Canadian husband in order  that  her Arctic nation  will not be annexed.  And, like the other innocents in The Man from Number 10, We  All Hate Toronto and countless revue sketches, she  remams  in  Canada; in  fact,  she marries  the  Governor-General (the  first

18

NOTHING SACRED



Canadian one,  that  is;  the  character, "G.G.", was  a  thinly-disguised caricature of  Massey), and   her  action  is a splendid  example  of  the  outrageousness of this kind  of humour. Elsewhere  in this musical  plot is dismissed  completely while  just about   every  Canadian  institution is  made  fun  of:  the  cultural exhortations of the  Massey  Report,  pretensions of  regional   poetry,   National Defence, Ottawa debutantes, Canadian  history  and  politics,  and,  especially,  the  galling   problem of  a  Canadian flag.  The   latter  is debated to  music  in  a  scene  in  the  House  of Commons where  each  member demands his own particular emblem:

Saskatchewan  wants shocks of wheat! The  Maritimes  want ships!
The  West wants mountains  topped with snow! P.E.I.'s  for potato chips!

Calgary wants a head of steer! Niagara  wants the falls! (Ottawa needs a mayor!
You can have Montreal's!)

The  Yukon wants a polar bear! Keewatin  wants a moose!
Baffin Island  wants a seal! Gander  wants a goose!

The   affection  for  imitation  mentioned above  with  regard to  Fuller  also  appears in  My  Fur Lady  but,  happily, it does not go much  further than  the spoof in  the title.  Finally,  there  is also present  here perhaps the most significant feature of this type of comedy  and  one  which  has not so far been  mentioned. This  is the humor­ ous  putting-into-words of  a  common   national problem   which  usually  gives rise to  enormous feelings  of  recognition and  relief  in  the  laughter  reaction.  A good example of  this  is the  speech  justifying  the  national hate  of  Toronto in the  Sin­ clair  play quoted above.  In  another Sinclair  play, The  New Canada, it takes  the form of an airing of a common Canadian dilemma:
NARRATOR:   Canada, as  you can  plainly see, is large ... It is, in  fact,  larger  all round  than  the  United  States.  That's why we get  a  little  hurt  at  this sort of thing:
AMERICAN:  So you're a Canadian, eh?
CANADIAN:  That's right.
AMERICAN:  Come from Canada, eh?
CANADIAN:  That's the idea.
AMERICAN : What  part of Canada  do you come from?

19

NOTHING  SACRED



CANADIAN:  I'm from Halifax.
AMERICAN:  Halifax,  eh? Hrnrn! I know a fellow from Canada; expect you've run into him.
CANADIAN:   (Smiling) Well, you never know.
AMERICAN:   Oh,  sure you'll know him, both  of you being Canadians. He  lives in
Vancouver.
CAN ADIAN : (Protesting) Yes, but you see ...
AMERICAN:  Fellow by the name of Ted Richmond.
CANADIAN:    (Astounded) Ted  Richmond! Ted  Rich  ... Well, of all  the  coinci­ dences! As a  matter  of fact,  I  do  happen  to know Ted  Richmond!  Isn't  that fantastic?
AMERICAN:    (Unconcerned) I don't  see  why  you're  so surprised.  You're  both
Canadian, aren't  you?

In  My  Fur Lady  there  is a line of this sort  which  never  failed  in performance to elicit  laughter and  applause from  its Canadian audiences; it  had  to do with  the familiar problem of  Canadian identity and  was  delivered with  a happy helpless shrug:

The  trouble with Canadians  is they spend half their time convincing the Americans they're  not  British, and  the  other  half convincing  the  British  they're  not  Ameri­ cans -which leaves them no time to be themselves.

Rough and  undisciplined though  it frequently may  be, this first kind of comedy is important here  because  its typical  features are  basic to the  Canadian approach to  dramatic humour (it  is possible, for example, to  recognize  the  characteristics of our  more  serious  comedy  as simply  refined  variations of these basic features) ; but  it is especially important because of the popular audience response it is usually able  to provoke.  The latter  indicates that  the  Canadian temperament is not at all disapproving of  satire:  one  would  almost  think   that,   having forgotten the  fact of  their  nationality, Canadians are  so pleased  to  be  reminded of it  in  a  theatre that  they  do not  care  how much  the reminder may  be at  their  own expense. Cer­ tain   subjects-even for  such  mischievous  satire   as  this-are  still  taboo,  it  is true: we shall  have  to look to a more  serious  work  like Robertson Davies'  Hope Deferred  for  any  attempt to  deal  humorously with  the  Church,  for  example. But  the scope of the  less serious kind of satire  is a wide one. If My  Fur Lady can make  even  a  French-Canadian  audience laugh   at  the  literary  imbecilities of  a prairie poet,  the  form  in  which  the  satire  is cast  is surely  not  to  be ignored or underestimated.

NOTHING SACRED


W.MOVE NOW  for  the  moment  out  of  the  realm  of Can­
ada's satire  and  into the hinterland of its gentle comedywhich is well-published
and  frequently performed by  amateur groups.  There is an  abundance of  plays here  in  one  act,  and  one  might  quite  understandably wonder  if this  is not  the particular dramatic form  in which  Canadians excel. Due  to the scarcity  of  three­ act  plays, however,  and  the  inferior  quality of so many  of these shorter ones, one is sadly forced  to conclude that  what  might  at first look like this country's plethora is just  any  other  country's quota  and  not  nearly  so good. Indeed, when  one  also considers  how  it  is short  revue  sketches  which  predominate in  the  category just dealt  with,  it  would  seem  that  we are  simply  not  fond  of doing  things  in a  big way.  But  is it our  audiencesor  our  writerswho  cannot sustain  the  greater length?
Many   of  these  plays  do  not  deal  with  settings  or  even  characters Canadian, their  milieu  and  dramatic style instead  ranging anywhere from  British  to Chinese. They  do  not  concern me  herefor  I am  only interested in the  way  Canada is reflected   in  our  dramatic  writing, however  obliquely,  and  in  this  respect  these exiles  reflect  only  bewilderment  (when  the  plays are  incompetent) or  flat  rejec­ tion  (when  they  are  not)  ; nor  do they illuminate any Canadian attitudes toward other   countries since  they  merely  absorb   and  imitate the  conventions  of  those countries and  make  no  comments from  without. Nevertheless,  towards  the  turn­ ing  out  of  a  good  play  this  approach is not  at  all  unrewarding for  some,  and indeed   success  along   this  line  is often  outstanding enough to  be  disturbing. In passing,  I would   note  particularly the  one-act   plays of  Norman  Williams, col­ lected  in Worlds Apart  ( 1956), worthy  of attention in any context, but  especially striking   examples here  of  the  flat  rejection   of  native  material paying   off  most handsomely.
Certainly the  most  difficult  problem   facing  the  Canadian  playwright is how
to  write  about the  people  and  the  places  he knows  and  understands when  these do  not  come  to  him  equipped  with  any  vividly  recognizable trappings of  race and  tradition. If he chooses not  to grapple with  this problem, his local  references, for  example,  no  matter  how   casually  dropped, only  seem  embarrassingly  self­ conscious,  and  it is a sad  truth that  his play will be much  better  off with  a setting  in  the  United States.  Hence a number of Canadian  playwrights take  advantage of the  ambiguously North American environment at  the  disposal  of  their  Ameri­ can  colleagues  and  make  their  own  dramatic milieu an  anonymous one,  dispens­  ing  altogether  with   nationality and   any  reference   to  actual  place  names.  But,

21

NOTHING  SACRED



unfortunately, this  technique can   hardly   be  said  to  be  successful:  the  results, usually  mild  drawing-room comedies  with  stock  themes  and  the kind  of  unrealis­ tic treatment found  in inferior  magazine stories, are uninteresting and quite  devoid of any  dramatic strength. And  where  the writing is insipid,  of course, the humour is insignificant.
The  majority of Canadian comedies  of this second  type,  however,  do deal  with
Canadian material, and,  happily, the native  approach usually  seems to be a more rewarding one,  resulting   in  a  fair  amount of  dramatic success.  But,  curiously enough, that  success is frequently achieved   here  only  within  a distinctly  limited point  of view, and  over a narrow range  of subject-matter. Note,  for instance, the extreme popularity of old  people  as protagonists for these  plays, or at least as the characters with   whom   the  playwrights' sympathies  are  most  actively  engaged. There would  seem to be a genuine, even an instinctive, predilection in our drama for  the  problems of the aged,  for the spectacle  of crusty,  sometimes cantankerous souls,  dogged   by  frustration and  inactivity, and,   accordingly, for  plots  which focus  on  such  things  as domestic  stagnation, garrulous gossips,  hen-pecked  hus­ bands, peacefully  smouldering feuds,  wrangles over  inheritances etc.  To say  the atmosphere is Chekhavian is not  really  an  exaggeration: these  are  lives of quiet  desperation, and  even  when  the  characters are  forced  to act,  when  there  is held out  some  bright   hope  of  release  (the  device  of  the  sudden  unexpected windfall  of money is extraordinarily popular with  these plays), some way to reject  or avoid the  escape  hatch is invariably found. And  beneath this  determined evasiveness, by the  way, it is often  possible to find the same  dogged sense of responsibility (to Canada?)  already noticed  in  some  of  our  frivolous  satires.  There is not  space here  to go into  one of these plays in detail  (although Robertson Davies'  Overlaid) a good  example, will be examined below), but  it is tempting to speculate why so many  should  choose  this limited  point  of view,  this  concentration upon  the  twi­ light  of age.  Perhaps it is only  because  the  juxtaposition of the  new  and  the  old (the one  in  setting,   the  other  in  characters)   is <esthetically pleasing; but,  more  probably, it is because  the  juxtaposition is a necessary  dramatic balance, that  the only  way  many  of our  playwrights can  cope  with  the spectacle of a young  fresh land  is by peopling  it with the tired and the senile.
But  even  should   less mature characters dominate the  scene,  the  field  of dra­
matic  exploration is limited  here  a second  time  by  a general reluctance to deal with  any  kind  of sophistication. When  these plays choose  to depict  a community, for  example, the  preferred  setting  is usually  a small  town,  not  a  big city-pre­ sumably because  life in  the  latter  cannot easily  be  distinguished from  the  same

thing  below  the  border. But  most  often,  and  no doubt  in  search  of an  environ­ ment   more  distinctively Canadian, settings  are  strictly  rural-the  bush,  the prairie, the  North. Characters inhabiting these  wastes are  similarly  homely,  and the  only  urban types  who  might  venture  upon  this rustic scene  are  painfully  at a disadvantage, like the tourists  in the work of Merrill  Denison.2   Indeed, the homely heroes  of  the  latter's plays,  in  their  ceaseless contests  with  these  tourists,  seem to belong   to  an   "essential" Canadian  type-the  same  stock  Canadian, in  fact,  who  has  been  idealized   in  so many  other  literatures. Here, at  home,  where  the literary regard   is more  candid, he  is slow-moving,  slow-witted and  illiterate, yet endowed with  a kind  of frank  simplicity  that  is  most impressive  in an  argument and   which,   when  exploited  humorously by  a  writer,  can  be  irresistibly  funny.  Syd,  one  of  the  backwoodsmen in  Denison's  Brothers  in  Arms, is a good  speci­ men.  He  has at his mercy  a Toronto couple, the Brownes, stranded in a log cabin  at  the  end  of their  vacation and  desperately in need of a lift to the  train  station. But  Syd  is not  easily  persuaded  to  co-operate in this matter, nor  even  to supply information about his taxi-driving colleague:
BROWNE:  It's  been dark half an hour. How long would it take him to get back?
SYD: I figure it'd  take him about half an hour if he had a boat.
BROWNE:  Half  an  hour,  eh?  Should  be here, then, soon. (thinks) Did  he have a boat?
SYD: No .... He didn't  have no boat.

It is one  of the  points  of the  play  that,  in contrast to the supposedly civilized  but bellicose  ex-officer  Browne,  his  "brother-in-arms" Syd  could  see no  point  in  the discipline  of the  army  and  was consequently discharged as useless. Syd is typical of  his kind  which  simply  cannot be bothered with  tradition or organized society and  prefers  instead  to live apart as a hunter  in the bush. Although he is frequently depicted as both  young  and  attractive and  may well have  an instinctive apprecia­ tion  for  the  beautiful in  nature (the  plainspoken  Barney  in  Sinclair's The  Blood is Strong  is a good  example, a slightly more heroic version of the type), neverthe­ less he  is  usually  both  unimaginative and  shrewd,  sometimes  living  just  outside  the  law,  operating a  still  or  engaged  in  petty  thievery.  Whether or  not  this fre­ quently ignoble  savage  can  be said  to be particularly Canadian (there might  well be  justification for  considering him  as  indistinguishable from  the  American hill­ billy), the  fact  is that  the  best of our gentle  comedy,  whose  business is character,

•  Denison is no doubt  the best native playwright to have dealt with this kind of gentle comedy;  most of his plays are collected in The Unheroic North (Toronto, McClel­ land and Stewart,  1923).

works  most  successfully when  dealing  with  unsophisticated people of this type.
Apart from  speculation on  why  they  should  be so fond  of certain subjects,  it is impossible  to  extract  from  plays like these  any  kind  of expressed  attitude,  to­ ward  Canada or  anything else. Of  course  this is partly  because  so many  of  them lack  any  dramatic strength to begin  with.  But even  those  which  have  been  neatly made  remain curiously  timid  and  mute: having  carefully  eschewed  any  provoca­ tive subjects, they  are  equally  careful  not  to comment on  anything  which  might  smack  of importance. Intended for a family  audience, perhaps the  plays must  be puritan and  comfortable, but  their diffidence  becomes extraordinary, unparalleled in  other  cultures: even  such  "comfortable" American  comedies  as Gore  Vidal's The  Best Man  and  F. Hugh  Herbert's The  Moon  is Blue, for example, still make their  respective  comments on  American  politics  and  sex. Our gentle  comedy  is more  like some  particularly innocuous Hollywood films, anxious to offend  no one, cautious and   flat,  mortally   afflicted  by  a  misguided gentility. Indeed  the  only really  interesting thing  about  these  plays is why  they should  turn  to the  mood  of comedy  in  the  first  place,  turn  to it so instinctively, as if it  were  the  only grease that  could  make  the dramatic machinery function. But is this to their  credit-or does it  merely  follow, from  their  general  inability  to consider  any serious  subject, that  they simply cannot consider  any subject  seriously?




OH SWINISH  and   contemptible men  of  Delphi! I have laboured  for  forty  years to lighten  your  ignorance,  diminish  your selfishness and increase  your  happiness! And I  have failed-not  for  lack of wisdom or struggle but  because  you are  beyond the  power of  wisdom  to cure.  The  curse  of  baffied and  wretched  Aesop be upon  you! 0 Apollo, let me die, for my life is bitterness!

A great  teacher's life work has been rejected  and  persecuted and  the mob is howl­ ing  for his blood.  Torn  by frustration and  despair, he at last loses his temper and  delivers   this  stirring denunciation. The   words  quoted  are  those  of   the  hero  of
Robertson Davies'   A  Masque  of  Aesop  ( I952) ,3  but  the  significance of the  di­
lemma   for  Canada is obvious  and  they  could  well  also  be  the  words  of any  of our  baffled -and best-playwrights.

from  their  entertaining qualities. In  short,  the  humour used  is really  more  than a mere sugar-coating, and  we can truthfully be said to be skilled in satire.4  Usually this  satire   is  directed against  ourselves and   is both   reproving and   corrective. Canada's response,  however, is nothing so electric  as Aesop's  Delphi  and,  unlike Aesop  as well,  our  Canadian satirists  have  no Apollo  who  will come  along  and proclaim the  nobility  of  the  prophet to  the  populace; and  so the  result  is that the  apathy, dull-wittedness and  indifference of the country inevitably become  the chief targets for the satire.
We  are  attacked for  our  intolerance, hostility  and   distrust-of  beauty,   wit,
grace   and   poetic  wisdom-and for  our  inability   to  appreciate the  wonderful. Just  as the  theme  of the  curious  innocent is a favourite device of our  more frivo­ lous satire,  so  to  make  the  point  here  there  is a tendency to employ  some kind of  Christ   figure   who  is  misunderstood,  abused, destroyed   or,  worse,  merely refused  admittance by our  aloof suspicious  land.  Jack  Gray's Ride  a Pink  Horse,  performed in Toronto in  1959,  featured a centaur who  was crushed  to death  by an  intolerant mob.  Lister  Sinclair's All About  Emily is an  instructive radio  fable which  names  no proper names,  but it is obvious for whom its message is intended. Here  the  extraordinary visitor  is Emily, the  proverbial goose who lays the golden  eggs.  Emily's beneficiaries make  quite  a  fuss over  her:  after  they  have  soothed their  feelings,  outraged by  Emily's  daring to be different, they  promptly put  her owners  in  jail and  proceed  to wrangle  over her gold, even forming a corporation to exploit  it. Never  once,  however,  do they express a jot of wonder, admiration or gratitude for  her  generous talents.  Eventually, because  of  the  threat she  causes international finance, she is murdered and  a perfectly ordinary goose is substituted in  her  place.  But  the  Phrenix   note  is gloriously  sounded  when  it  is announced that  the  new goose has laid  "in  quick succession no fewer  than  three  golden  eggs, each studded with diamonds!"
Robertson Davies'  martyrs are  less fantastic, and  consequently, like his Aesop,
more   poignant. In   Hope  Deferred  ( 1949)   the  Governor of  New  France  has created   something truly   wonderful:  he  has  had  a  native   Indian girl  educated in  Paris  to  perform Moliere  in  the  classic style of the  Comedie Franc;aise.  He  is doomed  to be disappointed, however,  and  is informed  by two of his bishops  that


4   And  bold  as  well-even  when  the  target  lies outside  our  national   boundaries. Ruben  Schip's  The  Investigator, for instance,  first presented  on the C.B.C. in 1954, caused  a  small  sensation:   it  was a  thinly-disguised attack  on  the  late  Senator McCarthy, and  a  recording  made  from  the  programme  had  a considerable  black market sale in the United  States.


25

NOTHING  SACRED



such  a performance will only serve to corrupt the  morals  of the Canadian French and  confuse  the  Indians. The   Governor argues  for  the  goodness  and  greatness of art but  he is up against  a state of mind  that  is unswervable:

The innocent  native arts of basketry and headwork are given reasonable encourage­ ment,  [says one of the bishops]  and  I  am  told  that  the squaws  at  Catarqui are preparing a set of altar  frontals  made  wholly from  dyed  porcupine  quills. These pursuits  are  innocent  enough;   even  the  most  abandoned  spirit  is  incapable  of expressing contumacity  or salaciousness in  beads  and  quills.  I  tell  you frankly,  I am glad  that  much  of that  nonsense called art  is far away in the old world ... A new land has not time for amusements which may be destructive.

In  Fortune, My  Foe  (I 949)   the  figure  in  whom  art  is embodied is a dedicated Czech  puppetmaster who is minus  a working  permit and  in danger of being ship­ ped  back  to Europe. A group of intellectuals who  are  thrilled  by his delicate skill attempt to  find  an  audience for  him  in  Canada. They fail,  of  course,  but  the play  ends   hopefully  with  the  artist  determined  to  remain  in  Canada, despite everything. Nicholas, the hero, tells him:

If you can  stay in Canada,  I can,  too. Everybody says Canada is a hard  country to govern,  but  nobody mentions  that  for some people  it is also a hard  country  to live in. Still, if we all run away it will never  be any better.  So let the geniuses of easy virtue  go  southward; I  know what  they  feel  too  well  to  blame  them.  But for  some of us there  is no choice; let Canada  do what  she will with  us, we must stay.

Except for  A  jig  for the  Gypsy  ( 1954), all of Davies'  plays  feature variations on some of the  problems  involved  in this decision,  and  they  are  consequently well worth  examination here. But I shall concentrate only on one of them-Overlaid
( 1949), perhaps Davies'  best play, and  one especially  useful for my purpose  since it  manages to  contain within   its short  one-act length   a  remarkable number of the  characteristics of Canadian humorous drama to  which  I have  attempted  to draw  attention.
The  story  of the  comedy  is straightforward and  simple.  An  old farmer lives in a dull  rural  community with his widowed  daughter. Both the  community and  the daughter attempt to suppress  his strong  appetite for such  "things that  make  life worth  livin' " as the  Saturday afternoon radio  broadcasts from  the  Metropolitan Opera in  New  York. An unexpected windfall  of money  from  his insurance policy suddenly gives  him  the  chance to  go  to  New  York  and  enjoy  all  the  exciting things  he  has  so sorely  missed. His  nagging unimaginative daughter is outraged and   accuses  him  of  being  selfish, and  when  he  forces  her  to  tell  him  what  she

NOTHING SACRED



most  wants  in  the  world,  a  granite tombstone for  the  family  plot,  he  gives  the money  to her.  The  humour of the play deals superbly  with  the daughter's narrow mentality  and   her  pathetic dream, makes  an  endearing figure  of  the  old  man, and supplies  enormous sympathy for his plight:
There's  always a gol-danged  necessity to get in the way whenever  you want some­ thin'  purty  ... I want  what's  warm an'-kind of mysterious; somethin' to make you laugh  an'  talk  big, an'-oh,  you wouldn't  know. You  just sit  there,  lookin' like a meat-axe,  an'  won't  even try to see what  I'm  drivin'  at.  Say  listen, Ethel: what d'you get out o' life anyways?

There are  a  number of  familiar features here:   we  have  already   noticed   the affection  Canadian playwrights display for the problems  of older  people,  the rural setting,   and   the  theme  of  the  sudden windfall.5 Further,  the  old  man   may  be regarded as a slightly  refined  variation of the above-mentioned "essential" Cana­ dian. The sacred  cow  under fire is Canadian life itself,  with its determined dull­  ness. And  just as our  other  kind  of satire  is able to put  into pithy  words a galling  national  problem, here  it  is the  desperate position  of  the  Canadian fighting  to possess the  beautiful that   is so  vividly  delineated-and  brilliantly rendered  in the  opening scene  of the  play  where  the  old  man,  dressed  in  a  battered "op'ry" hat  and  wearing white  cotton  workman's gloves, joins in  with  the applause of the Metropolitan audience coming  to him  over  his antique  radio.  And  finally,  there  is the  dilemma of whether or not it is possible to "stick" Canada, whether to give in  to  the  temptation to escape  or, instead, to  remain-in  a country where  one must  inevitably be  "overlaid" by ignorance  and  tedium. The  old  man  is forced to  make  the  choice-between  the  excitements of New  York and  the  depressing  dream of  his daughter-and of  course  it  is the  ties of kin  that  win. To  live in Canada, then,  presumably  requires a dogged  sense of responsibility, even  dedica­ tion-for  to succumb involves  sacrifice. Thus Overlaid  ends sadly,  with  the old man  giving  up his beloved opera  broadcasts:
Naw.  Turn it off.  [he  says] Don't  want  it now. I  been overlaid  and  I got to get myself back in shape.  Maybe  I been emotionally overstimulated. But I ain't over­ laid for good, Ethel, an'  that stone'll rest lighter on me than it will on you.


5   This  latter  feature  may not be particularly  significant (it is a popular  kind of deus ex  machina in drama  anywhere  and  is usually regarded  as a hackneyed  one too), but, as a device forcing  a reassessment of values, it does intrude  rather  frequently upon  the  Canadian dramatic scene-along  with the innocent  who provides  per­ spective,  the  martyr  who  upsets the  routine,  and  all other  visitors and  intrusions which foment  the action of our plays.



FREDERICK PHILIP  GROVE

A group of letters





Desmond Pacey






IHAVE IN  MY   po=O<ion  two  '"'' of  lettm hom Fredniek
Philip  Grove   (1871-1948). One  set consists of the  letters  he wrote  to me in  the
last seven  years of his life, when  I was writing various  critical  studies  of his work; the  other  set consists of letters  written  by Grove  to Dr.  Watson Kirkconnell over a  period  of some  twenty-five  years.  Dr.  Kirkconnell was good  enough, some five years ago,  to entrust his letters  to me for safe-keeping. At some date  in the future I hope  to  publish  in  book-form  a  complete   collection  of Grove's letters.  In  the meantime, and   with  the  permission  of  Mrs.  Grove,   I present   the  letters  which Grove  wrote  to me in the hope that  they will be of interest  to readers and  students of Grove's work.
My  first letter  to Grove  was written on  January 15, 1941. As part  of a series
of  radio   broadcasts presented  by members of  the  faculty of  Brandon College,  I had  been  asked  to  give  a  talk  on  "Manitoba in  Fiction". Having read  Grove's novels  in  my  undergraduate days  at  Toronto, I decided to  make  his  work  the staple  of my talk,  and  I wrote  to Grove  asking  him  a number of questions about his life, the  influences to which  he had  been  subjected, his aims  as a writer,  and so  on.  This  is  his  reply,  written   from  his  farm   at  R.R. 4,  Simcoe,  Ontario, on January 20,  1941:

In  reply  to your  letter  of the  15th  inst.  I  beg to say that  I shall  be glad  to assist you. Would  you care  to read  parts  of that  MS.  which  I originally meant to intro­ duce   by  the  chapter which  Woodhouse and   E.  K.  Brown  printed as  a  separate article in  the  U.  of T.  Quarterly? I might  look out  a  few  relevant  chapters. To  answer  your  questions in  a  letter  would  take  almost  as long  as  writing  that  book.

FREDERICK PHILIP GROVE



A few of the specific questions you ask I might  briefly answer  here.
Among  my Parisian friends of 188g to  1891 were Mallarme, Verlaine, Heredia, Henri de  Regnier, Jules  Renard, And11e Gide.  Since some of  them  are  still living, I  should,   however,   prefer   to  leave  them  in  twilight.  Among  the  Germans stands first Stefan George  whom  I consider  the greatest poet  of the  last 6o years.
I  don't think  that  any  novelist  has ever  influenced  me.  My  published  novels­ few of those  I have  written are  published-are mere  jottings  of what  I  have seen and   felt.   But  among   those   whom   I  admire  most  stand   foremost   the  Russians,  above  all Tolstoi.
Neither do  I  think  I have  any  very definite  aims in  writing. I try  to  put  down what  I  see. I have,  for  two  years, been  working on  a  panoramic novel  which  will require another two  years  to finish.  In  it, I aim at replacing the  time  sequence  by an  extension  in space,  giving  a whole countryside, with  its towns, farms, etc., with­ in  the  compass of a single  year.  I call  it "The Seasons".  If I live to finish it; and if, living,  I shall  find  the  leisure  to work  it out  as I  see it, it will  be an  enormous book, of course; I mean  a book of probably  over  1000 pages.
If you care  to read  parts  of that  un,published  autobiography of mine,  I shall  try to  pick  out  some  chapters which  throw  light  on  my  methods; there  are  two  or three  chapters dealing with  the  growth  of  FRUITS oF  THE  EARTH which  extends over  forty  years  between  conception of the central  figure  and  publication.
On  the other hand, an  opportunity might  offer to publish  the LIFE OF A  WRITER IN CANADA;  and  I should  have  to  ask you  to  return  the  MS  sections  shortly; I have only one copy.

I must  then  have  asked  him  to send  me  parts  of his autobiography ( unfortu­ nately  I did  not  keep  copies  of  my  letters,  and  must  rely  on  my  memory), en­ quired whether he regarded The  Seasons as his magnum  opus, and  asked whether the  naturalistic novels  of De  Maupassant and  Zola had  had  any  influence upon  him  as a youth  in  Paris.  On  February 2,  1941 he replied  to me as follows:

When  I  received  your  letter,  I tried  at once  to do  what  I  had  said  I'd  do;  but I found   it  an  almost  impossible  task.  I don't know  just  what  would  interest  you. So,  having to  go  to  town  yesterday,  I  despatched the  whole  of the  MS.  as far  as it  has  been  typed  out.  I  don't know that  it is in shape  for  publication as it stands; and,  of course,  since it  was typed  out  over a year ago, it is already  slightly out-of­ date.  However, I  thought the  best  thing  would  be to  let  you  browse  about  in  it. Now  there  is one  thing  I should  not like to see done,  namely  to see large sections quoted. I don't object  to  the  material being  used;  but  please  bear  in  mind  that  it is  an  unpublished  book  which   may  be  radically   altered before  I  publish  it  if  I
ever have  a chance to do so.
As for  "The Seasons"-yes,  as far  as fiction  is conerned, I have  the  deliberate purpose   in  mind   of  making it  my  magnum opus, by  which  I mean   that   I  shall put  into  it  (and have  already largely  put  into  it)   as  much   as  I  can  of  what   I

FREDERICK PHILIP  GROVE



have  seen  and  thought about,  not  of course  in  the  form  of philosophical  expatia­ tion,  but  brought to life in fictional  form,  in the thoughts or the fates of  the several scores  of characters and  the  hundreds of background figures.  It is an  undertaking of the  scope of a novel like "War and  Peace" -though I do not mean to compare my gifts with  those of Tolstoi.
Concerning the  Paris  episode  in my life, I might  perhaps add  that, though both
Maupassant and  Zola  were  still  living  at  the  time,  I  had  no  contact with  them except, perhaps, a  social  one;   I  don't remember. The figures  that   stand   out  in my  memory   were  the  poets.  Fiction   I  all  but  despised   as  a  half  way  house  to journalism. I myself was dabbling in poetry  at  the  time,  now in one language, now in another. The  reason  why I never  amounted to anything, at  the time, is probably precisely  the  fact  that  I  had  no  language of my own.  In everyday  life  I changed over,  with  the  greatest  facility,  from  French to  Italian, from  German to  English, and  even  from  Spanish  to  Portuguese. But  none  of  these  languages was  I  rooted in.  My  native  Swedish  I  had  almost  completely forgotten even  then.  The reasons for that  you may run across in that  manuscript.
If you go  to Caledonia in summer, yes, do  not  hestitate calling,  preferably after
having given  us notice  so we shall  be at  home.  We  have  a large  house. If you are married, bring  your  wife;  if you have  children, bring  them  as well;  we have  put up  as many  as five grown-ups at  a time; and  we have  all sorts of make-shift  ways of  putting up  youngsters  (acrobatic mats  make  a good  improvised bed  for  young bones), and   we  have  a  ro  yr.  old  boy  ourselves.  Our   house  is  always  open   to friends, especially  in summer; and  occasionally the  company is quite  international and  interesting. Though, since the war,  less so, of course.  We are  poor;  but  we like to share  what  we have.

I  returned the   manuscript of  his  autobiography   (subsequently  published,  of course, as  In  Search  of  Myself), and  he  acknowledged its safe  arrival on  March
I I, I94I:

The MS.  arrived safely a few days ago.  I  have  been  very ill for  a month or so and  unable to look after anything, so I have  not  missed it.
If I  can  find  the  time,  I  hope  to  re-read it  slowly, with  a view  to determining whether I think  it fit for publication.
Yes, if you wish it, I shall be glad to read  the script.
Meanwhile I  have  used  the  last  few  days  to  re-read the  first  part  of  my  new novel   "The Seasons" -the  part   entitled "Summer".  I  am   not  so  sure   that   I really  like it-but, I  believe, it is by far  the  best  thing I  have  done,  as it  is  cer­ tainly  the  most  ambitious. That first part  is in itself the  length  of a full-sized novel (ca.  8o,ooo  words); and  it contains scores of characters; what  the completed work will  be  like,  in  length  and  compass,  it staggers  me  to  think  of. But  it  is  most  un­ likely  that   it  will  ever  be finished,  though about half  of  the  remainder  is written or sketched.

Meanwhile, I had   prepared the  script of  my  radio talk,  and  sent  him  a copy for  his  approval. He  acknowledged its receipt on  April 2, 1941, and went  on  to make some  interesting comments on his novel  Fruits of the Earth:

I received  your  script; and,  though I do  not  agree  with  every  statement, far  be it  from  me  to  interfere. The mere  fact  that  you  mention nobody  else seems  un­ deserved  honour.
I  regret  that  you could  not  read  SETTLERS OF   THE MARSH. I should  gladly  have loaned  it  to  you, though I  believe I have  only a single copy. I consider  it the most important of my prairie novels.
I  am  not  sure  that  I know  what  dial-number taps  CKX or CKY, is it ggo?  At any  rate,  I  shall  try  to get  the  broadcast. Reception is rarely  good  from  the  west, I am sorry to say.
May  I say  that  FRUITS  OF THE  EARTH was never  intended to figure  as a novel?
I  meant it  to be taken  as a  piece of pioneer  history.  Its  original title  was CHRONI­ CLES  OF  SPALDING  DISTRICT.  What I  wished  to  bring  out  in  the  book  is  the  slow decay  of  a  great   potentiality. The cards  are  stacked  against  Spalding,  of  course. He  is  slowly  being   bent   into  taking   the  'slings  and   arrows'  personally. See  his reflections  on  the  decay  of man's work:   the  brick  dust  from  his house,  etc.  How­  ever, it is your  perfect right  to dislike it or to find fault with it. Recently somebody, in  discussing  with  me some  of my books, suddenly  exclaimed, "Ah,  but  FRUITS OF THE  EARTH!   There is  a  book  which  will  begin  to  Jive  roo   years  from  now."  I merely smiled.  Let's  wait and  see.
At any rate,  many  thanks.





ERE     then  an  interval of almost two  years  in  our  corre­ spondence. Early in  1943 I was  asked  by the editors of the  Manitoba Arts Review to  write   an article for  that  magazine, and   I decided to  expand the  radio script on  Grove for  that purpose. I sent  the  biographical section of the article to Grove in  order that he  might check   its  accuracy, asked  him  if  he  was  doing any  new writing, and recommended that he read  Sinclair Ross's  As For Me and My  House ( 1941), a  prairie novel   which I  felt  sure  he  would greatly  enjoy. This was  his brief  reply, dated February 16, 1943:
I think  the  biographical sketch is all right-I have added one name. I shall look forward to seeing the complete article.
No, I have  not  been doing  much.  It seems all so futile.
I  read  your  short  story  "The Hired   Man", if I  remember the  title  correctly. I
liked it very much. It is very true indeed.

Please  excuse  my  brevity.  I  am  hunting the  dollars   to  keep  the  wolf  from  the door.
P.S. No, I have  not come across "As For Me & My House."

When, that  May, I  sent   Grove the  Manitoba Arts  Review containing  my article, it  provoked  from   him   a  most  interesting letter about his  novels.   Dated June 1, 1943, the  letter reads as follows:
Thank you  very  much  for  sending  me  the  essay in  the  Manitoba Arts  Review which  I enjoyed  reading.  Not, of course,  that  I agreed  with  everything. How  could that  be?  But  I feel  in it  a sincere  attempt to come  to grips  with  matters, which  I appreciate very much  indeed.
May  I point  out  some one or two trifles?
(I) Page  34, the  quotation from  Settlers. Now  the  intention of that  passage  was to  convey  the  intoxicating speed  of things.  I myself  when  I read  it, involuntarily fall into  a chant. Any word added  could, to me, break  that  chant.
It was,  by  the  way, Settlers   which  was  so  ruthlessly cut  down,  from  3  long volumes  to one short one. Hence the dots.
( 2)  Re  Fruits  of the  Earth. This  book did  end  with  a  tragic  climax  when  first written. I  remember talking   to  a  publisher   who  particularly  admired and   liked that  ending; and  it  occurred to me  during  that  conversation that, considering the conditions in  the  West,  this  ending   was  not  true.   I told the publisher of  my thought. He  exclaimed. "No," I said,  "Abe  Spalding, hero  though he  is in  one way, lies down  under  that  blow. I shall  have  to rewrite the ending." The publisher told  me  right  then  and  there,  "If you  do,  you  will have  to count  me  out." "All right," I said. "Let the  book lie." It waited  five years;  but  I assert  that  the ending is true.
However, page 36, bottom: that  is a bad sentence, very bad indeed.
It is a  disadvantage to  let  books lie  through years  and  years;  one  gets  used  to one's own mannerisms; one does not even notice  them  in proof-reading.
Does not "a  trap" (pge 39)  presuppose a trapper? I know of none.
It goes  without saying  that   I did  not  know  Dreiser's American Tragedy when I wrote  The Yoke of  Life. The end  was suggested  by the  actual sight  of the chat­ tering   rocks  in  Lake  Winnipegosis. But  the  meaning of  that  ending is, of  course, that  Len  wants  something so much  that  all else falls away  (education, etc.); that  he will pay any price to get it. There is no intention of pessimism  there.
However, those are trifles; and  I appreciate the intention of the article.

On   December 29,  I943  I  sent  a copy  of the  Manitoba Arts Review  article to Dr.  Lome Pierce, then  editor-in-chief of Ryerson Press,  suggesting that the  article might be  expanded into   a  book  on  Grove. After some hesitation,  Dr. Pierce eventually  commissioned me  to  write   the  book, and  it  was  published in  1945· Meanwhile, at  about the same time  that I first  wrote to Dr.  Pierce, I had written

32

to Grove to ask  him  whether he would approve of such  a book  being undertaken. His  reply, mistakenly dated January  I8,  I943   (I am  sure   the  correct date was I944), indicates that  Grove had   more   modesty than  he  is  usually given  credit for,  and that he  was  ready to  help  a young  and quite unknown author:
I received  your enquiry yesterday  and  will answer at once.
I  believe,  on  the  one  hand, that  such  a book would  be timely  and  fear,  on  the other, that   there  is not  enough of my work  published  to warrant it.  It is perhaps natural that  the writer  should  always consider  his later  work as the more important; and  to me  it  sometimes  seems  that  nothing of any great  importance has yet been published. Our   purveyors of  printed matter are  too  timid; and  not  one  of  them is willing to invest in a future.
However, I  am  willing  to  assist you  in  any  way I  can; and  I  shall,  therefore, first  of  all  try  to  find  the  MS.  of  that  autobiography. This  was  not  meant   to be published till  after  my death; there  are  things  in it  which  might  hurt  people  still living. I trust  that  you will not touch  on them.
As for  my  magazine publications, I  have  no list; but,  apart from  early  work­ before   I928  or  I929-I can,  I  believe,  put  together such  a  list and  shall  try  to do so.
Miss  English•   I  do  not  remember except  as a little  girl  whom  I  started on  her study  of  French. But  Ernest Birkinshaw•-I  still call  him  Ernest-is  very vivid in  my  memory.   I  have  sometimes   wished  that   an  opportunity should   come  my way  to  go  west  once  more,   to  lecture   or  something.  I  should   like  to  meet  him again.   Naturally, I  often   meet  former   pupils  of  mine; and   a  fine  lot  of  young men  and  women  they are.
I  am  sorry  to say that  my physical  condition is not  too good;  and  my economic
condition is wretched.

When, in  late  January of  I944, I asked  Grove  to give  me  a  list  of  his contri­
butions to the  periodical press,  he replied on February 3 as follows:

I  have  been  laid  up  with  the  flu;  so please excuse the  delay  in sending you the list of my magazine contributeions as far  as I can  [lay] my hand  on them.

I seem  to  have  overestimated the  number. But  there  were  occasional  contribu­ tions   to  Macleans  (I928),  The  Winnipeg Tribune  (I926  or   I927),  Saturday Night   ( I932 ?) , The   London Free  Press.  That's all  I can  think  of;  and  Iseem to have  none of the latter  group.

Shortly afterwards I became confused, on  reading Grove's manuscript  auto­ biography, about the  date of his birth. This date had always been  given  as 1872, but   the   chronology of  events recorded  in   the   autobiography  suggested  that it must  have been  187 I. I wrote to ask him  about this  matter, and  this  is his reply,  dated February 8,  I944:
You  can  readily  imagine  that,  in  a  life in  which  over  20 years  are,  as it  were, taken   out   and   thrown   away,  chronology gets  confused. Iam  not  even  sure  any longer  that  Iknow  in  what  year  I was  born.  The only  thing  Ihave  to  go  by is that  my mother said  to me, in a conversation I remember very distinctly, that  the great   event   happened  a  year  after   the   Franco-Prussian  war.  But   whether  she meant by that   I87o  or  I87 I, I can't tell.  I have  given  my  age  as if Iwere  born anywhere between   I87I  and   I873.  I believe  that   the  sequence of events  as given in  my  "Life" is essentially  correct; but  ...?  For  nearly  22 years  no  birthday  was ever  celebrated  ( I8g2  or  I893  to  I9I4 when  Imarried); from  then  on  the  years are as it were certified; before that  everything is guess work.
So, if you  will kindly  try  to bring  some order  into  the  sequences, I will  promise to accept  it and  to govern myself accordingly from  now on.
I might  add  that  Iam  going  to Toronto tomorrow, to  try  to get  some arrange­ ment   made to  publish  THE MASTER  OF THE MILL which  Iconsider  as  the  most important book  Ihave  written. I shall  try  to  have  it  followed  by what  I call  the ANT book.  There are  some 4 or 5 volumes  awaiting publication; probably the  last
I shall finish, at  least if the state of my health is any indication.




lERE FOLLOWED  an  interval of  almost a  year,  during which Grove  was  very  ill.  Mrs.  Grove wrote to  me  on  June 4,   I944 to  say  that her husband "had a  stroke  on  April 14  and  had had   quite a  trying time  though he is able   to  walk   by  now.  But  his  right hand remains paralyzed." The next  letter from Grove himself   was  not  written until  January 4,  I945, and   was  a  reply   to my enquiry about the expected appearance of The Master  of the Mill:
Work  on THE MASTER OF THE MILL started on Feb. 8,  I944, and  the printing was finished  in  August,  after  many  intolerable delays,  due  to government interference

(priorities). Then started the fight for binding cloth  which,  I have  just heard, has at last been won. I believe the book will be out inside of a week.
You, too, will have  to be patient.
May  I say that  W. J. Alexander, in one of his last discussions  of my work  (with Carleton Stanley, Pres. of Dalhousie U.)  called  the book "ultimate and  enduring", as Stanley  wrote  my wife. Since  I thought the world  of Alexander, I was proud  of that  verdict.
I  have  half  a  dozen   books  in  the  stocks,  but  my  health is improving so very slowly  that   I  am  quite   despondent. My  doctor  says it  may  take  five years  to get back  to something like normal.
I can  type about I/3 of a page a day;  nothing  when  I write  a letter.

His  next  letter, dated January 20,  I945, invited me  to  read the  manuscript of what he  then called The  Ant-book (it  was  published as Consider  Her  Ways in I947), an  invitation which I was happy to accept:
I  trust  that  by this  time  you will have  received  the  copy of THE MASTER. I had to leave the distribution to Macmillans, being unable  to do anything myself.
I am getting ready  for  the long rest and  looking over  my shelves of mss. Most  of them  I  discard   and  use for  fuel.  But  I  had,  40 years  ago,  3 mss. which  I wished to  finish.  One  is THE MASTER. Another, which  I  have  just  reread, cancelling the
23-page   preface, is  the  Ant-book; and  I  am  much  impressed. It  was  finished  in
1920,  and  I  found only  one  word  which  I  wished  other. I  am  planning to bring it  out.  Would  you care  to read  the  typescript? If so, I should  try  to ship  it to you as soon as I can.  I should  like you to answer one question: is it interesting? Other­ wise I shall discard it, too.  Please let me know as soon as possible.

In his letter of January 30,  I 945,  he had  more  to say of the  novels  which were still  in  manuscript form. Having in  the  autumn of  I944 moved to  the  University of  New  Brunswick, which has  in  the  Hathaway Collection a fine  group of  Cana­ dian books  and manuscripts, I  had  suggested to  him  that his manuscripts might be  added to  the  collection. His  reply  to that suggestion again  reveals his modesty.

I  have  yours of Jan. 24 and  shall, therefore, at the first opportunity, when some­ one  goes  to  town,  send  a  ms. of  the  Ant-book  along.  It is a carbon  copy;  but  a good  one,  and  the  only  one  which  still  contains  the  preface. I  hope  you'll  enjoy its "envergure".
As for  other mss., my boy and  I weighed  what  there  is:  135 lbs., without dupli­ cations.  I  have  reread  three  complete novels:  one which  my wife hates  ... ; no.  2, one  which  struck  me  as important, Art  vs. Life. with  art  conquering; decades  ago I  put  it  aside  because   a  friend, the  only  person  who  has  read  the  ms. called  it "cocoon  spinning", but  I  think  it good;  no. 3, another prairie novel,  not  bad,  but unimportant. Years   ago,  the  U.  of  Toronto made   me  the  same  offer  that   you (Hathaway Collection)  make  now.  I  can't  make  up  my mind. Certain things,  no

doubt, are  so weak,  though I  haven't met  with  them  yet,  that  I'd  rather see them done  away  with.  Hardly any  bear  a date.  But,  in fifty years, one  is bound  to  pro­ duce  a  lot  of  piffie. The   Ant-book,  however,  was,  after   20 yrs. of  study,  written in  I920.3

Grove went on  re-reading his  unpublished manuscripts through the  month of
February, writing me on February 28, 1945 as follows:

I  have  the  ms. of the  ant-book (which  is hardly a  title,  is it?), still  unopened, but ...
I shall make  an attempt to place it. Macmillans are afraid of it.
I  have  now  reread   some  50 or  6o  essays and  short  stories,  condemning some, putting  the  others back  into  their  drawers. Also  8  novels,  of  which  I  have  fed
4 into  the fire, leaving
THE  CANYON
JANE ATKINSON  (western  stories)
TWO LIVES  (Ontario, good in the skeleton,  doubtful in the flesh)
FELIX POWEL's CAREER  (college  youth; ms. belonging to my wife, to do with  as she pleases; the extreme of sex)
apart from  the  ant-book, and  autobiography which  I  may  destroy,  at  least  partly, for  I don't think  anybody  would  be interested in the  European part; I am  not.
There are  still  two  drawers unexplored, in  my  desk.  Since  you  are  my  bio­ grapher, apart from  Eaton's THESIS, I  thought it well  to let you know  these facts. The above  novels I do not intend to offer.
Re  ant-book: do  you think  I  should  leave  the  introduction ( 24 pages)   or start
with  Wawa-quee's narrative? There is also 4-vol.  novel:   THE  SEASONS  (Ontario)
which  I have  not yet run  across.

A  brief   note   on  March  I8  merely gave   me  the  particulars about Charles E. Eaton's thesis  on   Grove. Then  followed an   interval of  several months, during which  Grove suffered a  second stroke. When  he  wrote on  August 26,   I945,  it was to acknowledge the  receipt of my book on him:
I  had  recently a  second  stroke  which,  for  the  time  being,  deprived me  of  my speech and  generally set me back.
I  know  my  wife  wrote  to  you,  but  don't   know  what.  She  is not  at  home   just now;  so I  can't ask her.  I  should  like to say a few  things; so I struggle  with  the typewriter.
Suppose I had   had  your  criticisms  while  writing my  books  and   had  adopted them  all;  then  my  books would  have  been  your  books, not  mine.  I  therefore wel­ come  your  criticisms,  with  some of which  I  agree; with  others,  not.  Occasionally I  feel  that   out  of  my  strength you  have  made my  weakness; but  that   does  not

3  I  should   say  that, for  reasons  of  discretion, I  have  omitted two  passages  of  this letter  of January 30, 1945. All the other  letters  are  printed in their  entirety.

matter. On   the  whole  I  feel  rather flattered that  you  should  have  felt  the  books to  be of sufficient  importance to discuss them,  for  I feel somehow  that  your  book is very  honest; though I also  feel occasionally  that  you over-estimate my  import­ ance, flatteringly. But  I wish to thank  you. I hope  the  book will find many readers. I  hear  that  something is being  translated into  French (GANTS  ou  CIEL) .  My  wife, feels 'bucked'. Poor  girl.  I  shall  likely have  to give up  my fellowship  in  the  Royal  Society,  for  I can't afford   the  fees. However  ... Will  you  be in  our  neighbour­ hood?  It is over  a  year  since  I have  seen  any  visitor.  The  last  one,  strange, was a  Swede;   the  last  but  one,  a  German Professor  of English   (I 938)   who  told  me that  all  my  works  were  in  the  libraries  of  Berlin  and  Munich. No  Canadian has
come since W. J. Alexander (I 932) .

This was  the  last  letter of  any  length that Grove  wrote me.  His  health quickly deteriorated  and   after  1945 all  communications were   through his  wife.   There were  however three brief   notes  from  Grove himself  in  the  late  months of  1945. The first, dated September 3, 1945, reads:

Just  a  word  in  answer   to  yours  of  Aug.  29.  THE  MASTER sold  out  within  two months, in I ooo  copies;  that  was all Macmillans would  risk.  I  had  a limited  edi­ tion  of  400 copies  most  of  which  remain  on  my hands. As usual,  to  me  the  book is a loss. Perhaps it is lucky  that  I have  nothing that  can  be taken  from  me.
What they  are  translating into  French, I don't know, except  that  they asked me, through Ed Collin, for FRUITS OF THE EARTH.
"Who is there?" Well, there  is E. J. Pratt.
As for  the  Ant  book,  I  intend   to  offer  it  to  Reg  Saunders. Macmillans don't
want  it.
Sorry,  that's all I can  write.

The second note, dated November 24,  makes apparent  the  exhausted  state of his health:
Thanks for the off-print.
I am getting worse. I don't believe any longer  that  I'll recover.  But ....
I've  been  wanting to tell you that  Carleton Stanley  applauds your  book, though he  disagrees  with  your  criticism.  He  (as  did  W.  J. Alexander)  places  THE  YOKE
OF LIFE first, as a novel  and  calls it "great". As for the  philosophy, he says, "When will  North-Americans  begin   to  catch   up  with  the  thought of  F.  P.  Grove?" I believe  he  would  like  to  write  another book;  he announces his  prospective visit. Since I am fond  of him,  I look forward  to it  (probably in Jan.)
I am sorry; this exhausts me,

The last  note was  dated December q, 1945, and  is a moving combination  of hope  and  apprehension:
We cannot afford  Christmas cards, So here are our best wishes of the season.

37

FREDERICK PHILIP  GROVE



No,  I  am  not  aware  of  a  new  printing of  the  MASTER.  As for  FRUITS OF THE EARTH. Ryersons  bought  the  remainder in  1938.  I get  nothing out  of it.  Someone sent  me the  Saturday  Night of Nov. 24. Stanley  is reviewing your  book in the Jan. Dalhousie  Review, so he  writes  me.  My total  royalty  on  the  MASTER was $rog  for
14  yrs. work.  But  I  have  sold  the ANTS.  That's something. Macmillans want  the autobiography. I don't know.
However ...
I  had  yesterday  the  most  painful day  since  my illness:   hands and  mouth. Hor­ rible.  Do  you  know  that  my  boy won  a scholarship for  a year  at  St.  Andrew's. I expect  him  home  next  Wednesday. First in Latin, French, and  Greek, so far.

Frederick  Philip Grove   died   on  August  rg,   1948. There  are  still  some   who belittle him; most  Canadians ignore him; but  I believe  that his work  will endure.












THE CREATION OF FANTASY
The fiction of
Catherine Anthony Clark




Joan Selby






MODERN l"ANTASY   fo, children  lli the culmination  of a long  literary  tradition. Time  and  setting  may be as new as today,  but  themes  and creatures are  those of the stories told to answer  old, unanswerable questions. What is Good?  Why  is Darkness? Who  am  I? The  imaginative tale appears in an intel­ lectual  climate already ripened   by  a  developed   mythology.  Its  protagonist  takes on  the same  giant  proportions as does the hero of the myth  and legend.  He  dares  to  enter  the  Underworld; he  faces and  slays dragons; he seeks  and,  in  the  find­ ing,  he  vanquishes the  very  forces of Evil. These  are  the  dimensions of both  the traditional myth  and  the  modern imaginative tale and  it is impossible  to conceive of the second  without the example of the first.
The   difficulties  of  writing fantasy  for  Canadian children are  obvious,  for Canada lacks a homogenous mythology.  There are two heritages, the  Indian and the  European, but,  while  each  of  these  has  its riches,  neither  wholly  belongs  to the  Canada of today. The Indian legends are from an alien  and  forgotten culture and  children find  them  difficult.  Powerful   as  they  are,  they  speak  of  unknown ways of the  imagination, of the questionings of a primitive  people,  and  they latk immediacy for  children whose  inheritance is more  surely  drawn from  European lands   where   folk  literature has  gained   a  greater   degree  of  sophistication. The Indian  tales  have  a  starkness at variance with  the  softer,  subtler   story  more familiar to children in  this  country. Consider the fairy  stories.  The  versions  best known   to  Canadian children (as  to most  English-speaking children)  are  drawn from  Perrault. Reflecting the  age in which  they were written, that  of Louis XIV, they  are,  essentially,  stories  of  courtly  manners. Although told  with  Gallic  sim­ plicity,   they  still  display   the  over-elaborate  refinement of  taste  that  marked

39

THE CREATION OF  FANTASY



France's great  age.  Whatever elements  these tales contain from  a ruder  age  (and they  do  contain some),  they  still  remain   opposed   to  the  instinctive, primitive Indian legend.
Owing to  the  lack  of  a  developed   and   indigenous folk  literature, Canadian
writing for  children   had  not  been  rich  in  fantasy. Among the  few  writers  who have  attempted the  imaginative tale  for children in  this country, Mrs.  Catherine Anthony Clark  is the only one who has attained a measure  of real achievement.
Mrs.  Clark  has  not only attempted the integration of the two cultures; she has also  drawn on  differing  forms  of folk lore.  She  writes  fantasy  that  attempts the heroic  dimensions of legend,  the high adventure of fairy  tale, and  the deep,  moral implications  of  mythology.   She  synthesizes   rather  than   creates.   She  takes  the essence of each  form  and  puts it to appropriate use within  her framework of plot and  situation. From  the  myths  she has  taken  their  central and  dominant theme, the  conflict  between  Good  and  Evil, and  each  of her books is concerned with  the triumph of Light  over Darkness. From  the legends  she has taken  the hero  figures, the  larger-than-life proportions; from  the  fairy  tales  the  climate  of credulity and belief  that  lends  suspense;  and  from  the  folk  tales,  those  earthy   and  endearing men  and  women  who  inadvertently touch  off  the  magic  by unthinking word  or action. These  gleanings from  ancient sources  are  used throughout her four  books, The   Golden  Pine  Cone,  The   Sun  Horse,  The   One-Winged  Dragon  and   The Silver Man.
Much  of the synthesis that  Mrs. Clark  achieves  between  the  European and  the
Indian tales  is necessary  because  she is attempting fantasy  in  a  Canadian  back­ ground. The   mountainous, lake-filled  Kootenays which   are  the  settings  for  her stories  are  not,  obviously,  the  natural habitat of the  rarefied  and  delicate  fairies of Europe. Her  fairies must  be less of gossamer  and  more of  buckskin. Mrs. Clark  uses the wild, unrestrained beings of the Indian myths-Wild Woman, Thunder­ bird,  the ominous figure of the  Hunter-as the prime  movers in her  books. Yet, Mrs.  Clark's creatures are seldom  wholly  from  one  or  other  of the  two  cultures, but,  rather, are  hybrids  of  both.  Princess  Onamara of The  Golden  Pine Cone, for  example, is  derived   both  from  that  familiar of  the  Indian tales,  the  magic woman  who  dwells  apart, and   from  that   of  the  European  tales,  the  heartless  princess  imprisoned in  the  friendless  world  of  self.  Such   minglings give  added dimensions by writing  the  two  traditions which  form  the  Canadian heritage  and  pointing to similarities rather than  differences.
The  strongest  single element, however,  is the  Indian. Indian life and  ways are always  a dominant ingredient and  the central episodes of Mrs.  Clark's books take

THE CREATION OF  FANTASY



place in a long-forgotten  land inhabited  by a lost tribe. This land does not contain the smoke-filled villages of reality, but, in keeping with  the magic themes, it is a land  that knows only the ceremonial side of Indian life. Rites and ceremonies, the seeking of  the  Good,  the  propitiation  of the gods, are  the  daily observances  by which its inhabitants live. Mrs. Clark is quite capable of realism in this area when it suits her  purpose,  for she is aware  as all writers of imaginative  tales must be, of the necessary interplay  between reality and fantasy. The  sea hunt for the killer whale in The  One-Winged Dragon is a good example of her handling  of actual, taut adventure  within the boundaries of the fantastic.
In  each  of her four  books the boy and  girl leave the Outer  World  and  enter
the supernatural land  in search  of a relative or friend  who is bewitched  by the powers of Evil. With the aid of the Indians and the magic instilled in them by possession of an  Other  World  charm,  the children  prevail and  fulfil their quest. This simple plot lends itself readily both to the recreation  of the myth and to the pursuit, capture  and escape of the adventure  tale.






LITTLE HAS been said of Mrs. Clark's  "borrowing" from the folk tales. It  is these tales rather  than  the others that supply  the human  element. The  human  beings in  folk  lore may  be  perverse, or  roguish, or foolish;  they have  individuality and  flavour.  Mrs.  Clark's  human  beings  are  strong,  vocal and  decided,  and  stand  in  direct  contrast  to the more ethereal,  magical  beings. She  has followed  tradition  in  making  these characters  national  types, fully and unmistakably  of the  country  from  which  the tales spring.  Her  men and  women are authentic  Canadians and  as such they bring a further  richness to the "Cana­ dianism"  of her books. The  Flame-Lighter  Woman of The  Sun  Horse is undeni­  ably a witch, but she is also a sharp-edged  pioneer. "I am not one to let fruit go to waste. There  was no waste in my Ontario home. I had raspberries in the wagon in sealers. Put  them  up driving  through  the foothills ...." Here indeed  speaks the  woman  who  dared   the  prairies in  the  covered  wagon,  her  vast courage equalled  only  by  her  fearful  busyness. In  The  Golden  Pine Cone  we have  the legendary  trapper  and  man of the northern  lands, Bill Buffer, whose sound "horse sense and  no nonsense"  brings a relieving, everyday realism into  the never-never land.  Uncle  Barker  of  The   Silver  Man  and  Kwong  Hu  of  The  One-Winged Dragon are  authentic Canadiana; the one in the character  part of the old pros-

THE CREATION OF FANTASY



pector  turned  homely mentor,  the other,  with  his quiet  acceptance  of suffering, a  true  and  touching  portrait  of the Orient-born Canadian. Indeed,  Kwong  Hu is a daring  character  to create for children, for his depths are outside a child's experience, and a full realization of his character must depend on a child's sympa­ thetic  response to quietness and dignity and sorrow.  Not only do these characters  deepen  and  authenticate the Canadian settings  of the stories;  they  are also true inventions in themselves.
The  transitions  from  the Real  to the Unreal   World  are difficult to handle  in
the writing  of fantasy. They  must be smooth  and  unforced  and  able to bear  the weight of credulity.  Mrs. Clark has introduced an interesting device to make these transitions  effective and  psychologically sound.  At least one of the two children in each book is in some measure at variance and  at "outs" with the actual  world. He or she hovers already on the edge of the Other World which is also the World of Wishes where unhappiness dissolves in magic. Mark of The  Sun Horse has but recently  lost both  parents  and  must somehow  reconcile  himself to the narrower, more  circumscribed  life that  is all his aunt  can  offer. ".... I was half  dream­ ing ..." says Giselle, Mark's companion,  and  indeed she is, for she is one of those children  whose gaze is forever inward  and  whose search -no  matter  what  the immediate  object-is always for the inverse of reality. The One-Winged Dragon gains  considerably  in insight  because of the interplay  between  Jenni  whose fear of being unloved  has made her over quick to quarrel and  Michael  to whom  the same fear has brought  too great a caution  and  too old  a patience.  Fringa  of The  Silver Man  is actually  bewitched and lives eerily and inconclusively between the two  worlds.  Mrs.  Clark allows no morbidity  (a  taboo in books written  for chil­ dren)  in this depiction of some slight maladjustment, for it is but lightly touched upon  and  serves only to heighten  the  poignancy  and  strengthen  the  plausibility of the transition  and  entry into  the Other  World.  Confronted with  problems of their own, these children  are at once more real and  take a more convincing  part in  the  essential action  and  main  concern of the  myth,  the never-ending  war  be­ tween  Good  and  Evil. Mrs. Clark's stories gain  immeasurably here by the inter­  twining of the human  and superhuman  themes. In the larger,  more exciting tale, she does not forget her concern for the children,  nor their concern with the Outer  World.  In  each  book  the childrens'  problems are  resolved both in relation  to the Outside  and  in  accord  with the ultimate values that  prevail in the Inner  World. This  double  resolution  brings the two levels of her stories, the mythical  and  the real,  into  close and  believable harmony.  The  one  is but  the  reverse side of the other, and both together make the whole.

THE CREATION OF  FANTASY




SuccEss DEPENDS  upon  so many  diverse elements in the spinning of  the  imaginative tale.  Writers   must  know  the  appropriate limits  of fantasy  so that  no  false note  shatters the subtlety, the  rightness  and  brightness  of the  story.  That true   balance between  the  real  and  the  unreal  which  forms  the distincive  characterisic of fantasy  must  be maintained. There must  be  a certain suspense  and   tautness of  action; a  fey,  but  not  unbelievable mood; a  richness, but  a disciplined richness,  of language, concept  and  symbol.  That Mrs.  Clark  is not  without fault, but  that  she  is evolving  a  real  competence in  mastery  of her difficult   task  is  clearly   demonstrated by  a  quick  review  of  her  four   published books.
In The  Golden Pine Cone, the earliest of her books, there  is a certain awkward­ ness of style  and  lack  of integration. The  opening  sentence "Not  very long  ago and  not  very far  away  ..." is rather  too self-conscious  an attempt to capture the spirit   of  the  traditional  opening. The   magic  element   in  the  story  never  seems quite   real,  nor  the  real  quite   able  to  sustain  the  magic.  The  half-human, half­  fairy  creatures such  as  the  dog,  Ooshka, are  not  entirely,  nor  believably, real­  ized.  On  the  other  hand, the  wholly fairy  creatures such  as the  Lake  Snake  with its "belly-scales ... thin  and  soft as fungus" are satisfyingly eerie and  invocative of an  ageless  past.  In  this  first  attempt, however,  Mrs.  Clark  does demonstrate her feeling  for  the  symbolism  of  myth  and  fairy  tale,  for  the  needed  impetus of the adventure tale.  She  shows  an  ability  to make  her own such  traditional themes  as that  of the  giant-killer, the  bewitched   prisoner,  and  the  lost children. These  be­ come  the stock-in-trade of her  latest stories,  and  it is no small  tribute to her  skill that  she makes  this  rather small,  closed circle of  motifs appear fresh  and  vigorous  in each  repetition. Their very timelessness is, of  course,  a factor  in her favour.
The  second   book,  The   Sun  Horse, shows  greater   depth of  perception, more
rounded characterization and  easier  presentation. There is little  left  of the  hesi­ tant   and  rather disjoin ted  style of  the  first  book;  the  flow  of the  narrative is smoother; the  magical happenings are  motivated more  effortlessly.  The  human beings are  more  appealing and  in the Flame-Lighter Woman-as I have already suggested -Mrs.  Clark   creates  a  particularly  well-delineated  character of con­ siderable dimensions. It is in this book, also, that  Mrs. Clark introduces her device of  placing  her  children already upon  the  edge of the  Dream World. Nowhere is her  innate restraint more  apparent than  in  this delicate and  technically difficult situation.
Mrs.   Clark's excesses  are   those  of  language rather  than   of  sentiment. This


43

THE CREATION OF  FANTASY



lesser fault  is attributable to an ardour  not yet trained  to the acceptance  of  disci­ plined craft. There  is a tendency to purple passages, which is particularly marked in descriptions of the supernatural; Mrs. Clark  is much  more controlled in writ­ ing of the natural and  the everyday. The  Shrine  of the Love Magnet, the magic thing  the  children  seek to save  their  Indian   friends  from  the  Thunderbird, is hymned in technicoloured  terms of rose quartz,  black agate  and crystal swans. In the same book, however, she writes: "A  phrebe sang;  wild ducks flew. From  the wooded hill, two ravens came slowly sailing like sheets of  burnt  paper  ..." The simile used is, perhaps, not very original, but the three sentences together show a restraint  and  an  understanding of the necessary  balance  in style.
The  One-Winged Dragon illustrates another  problem  that  Mrs. Clark faces in her  attempt   to  integrate  basically differing  mythologies.  Here  it is the  Chinese and  the  Canadian Indian. The  challenge  of  welding  together  the  flavour  of Chinese literature  with its delicacy, urbanity and wit, with the more savage, less sophisticated  Indian  legend is manifestly a formidable task. As might be expected, Mrs. Clark does not manage this integration  without some distortion  of both. Of all her magical  beasts, the Chinese dragon  is the least believable and  weakest in delineation.  He  is a somewhat  sorry and  alien  creature, crippled  by more  than his damaged  wing.
In  Mrs.  Clark's  first three  books there is a  tendency  towards  over-writing,  a
lack of true  integration, and,  perhaps,  a certain  misdirection,  so that  the action arising  from  the  magical  circumstances  appears  to take  over  the story and  the author's control sometimes appears lost. In her latest book, The  Silver Man, Mrs. Clark  has  brought  her  art  a step  nearer  total  achievement. Here  she does not attempt  to weld together so many story forms, but gives full rein to an imagina­ tive adventure  myth in which the magic lies as much  in its pace and  tautness as it  does in  its supernatural elements. She develops  the  fey Franga,  half  human,  half  Other-World, and  sets her  against  the  steadfast  Kawitha  so  that  there  is contrast  and  subsequently  more  texture in  this story. The  central  theme  and  its symbolism-that of the  young chief whose blood  is slowly  congealing  to silver so that  he will be forever lost to the world of human  warmth-is more expertly and  authoritatively handled  than  a similar subject  in The  Sun  Horse. Artistically The  Silver Man  is the truest in concept and intent, for here the half-suggested but never fully realized conflict of the other books between  the Real  and the Dream World  for the loyalties of the characters becomes clearer.  Indeed, this subtle and adult  concept   (and  no  less adult  because  of the  necessary  simplification  of its



44

THE CREATION OF  FANTASY



presentation)  is the  backdrop  against  which  the myth  and  the  magic  flash this way and that and play themselves out.
It is still too early and the body of her work is too slight to decide whether  Mrs.
Clark  has succeeded wholly or only in part in creating a mythology for Canadian children  in  the  guise  of  modern  fantasy.  That   this is her  ambitious  design is apparent in the decisive manner  in which she attempts  the integration  of the two differing heritages,  and in the bold use she makes of the forms and basic ingredi­ ents of the fairy tale, folk tale and legend.

Quelques  aspects des rapports  Litteraires entre
la France, la suisse romande  et le Canada Fran(ais


Gerard  Tougas




Nous VIVONS,  dans  cettc seconde pa<tie  du  vingtii'me siecle, une epoque de synthese. La traduction dans les principales  langues de !'oc­ cident  des chefs-d'reuvre des pays asiatiques,  traduction entreprise  par !'Unesco, est a cet egard un signe des temps.
II n'est  done  pas surprenant  que !'etude  de Ia litterature canadienne-franc,;aise
conduise  a Ia Suisse romande.  Si, comme l'a  demontre  Roger  Caillois, dans son Tresor  de la  poesie universelie  ( 1958), toutes les poesies se ressemblent, combien a plus forte raison, deux petites litteratures  ayant  le franc,;ais comme langue vehi­ culaire, ne doivent-elles pas posseder de traits communs!
Je  distingueria,  parmi  ces traits communs,  trois problemes  importants, devant lesquels Canadiens  et Suisses sont contraints  de prendre  position dans  leurs rap­ ports avec Ia France.  II s'agira  d'abord  de l'emploi  de Ia langue  franc,;aise, ensuite de Ia situation  de I'edition nationale, et enfin de !'influence  de Ia critique litteraire.
Mais avant  d'en  arriver a ces considerations, il est indispensable  d'expliquer ce
que  j'entends  par  "litterature romande" et "litterature canadienne-franc,;aise".
En Suisse romande,  de bons esprits se sont demande: "La  litterature romande existe-t-elle?"  Jusqu'a une  epoque recente, Ia  meme  question  s'est  posee au Canada concernant Ia litterature canadienne. Or, degager  Ia notion de litterature romande  ou de litterature canadienne  constitue  en soi un exercice de litterature comparee.  Si  riche  en renseignements  que  soit Ia recherche  d'une  definition  de ces deux petites litteratures,  cette recherche aurait !'inconvenient de nous eloigner des trois problemes auxquels  il vient d'etre  fait  allusion. C'est  pourquoi  j'ai pre­ fere m'en  tenir a une position theorique qui exclut toute polemique.  L'on voudra bien admettre que depuis de nombreux siecles, il s'est trouve, en Suisse romande,  des  ecrivains,  et  qu'au   Canada franc,;ais,  les generations litteraires  se succe­ dent  depuis  Ia  premiere  moitie du  dix-neuvieme siecle. Ces  ecrivains,  qu'ils soient  suisses ou  canadiens,  ont  reagi  devant  des problemes  linguistiques  qui  se ressemblent;  ils ont  du  compter  avec !'edition  et aussi avec  Ia critique  litteraire

UNE EPOQUE DE  SYNTHESE



de leur  pays. Dans  tous les cas, la France, par  l'intermediaire de sa litterature, de sa langue  et  de sa culture, s'est  trouvee  au  centre  meme  de leurs  preoccupations litteraires. C'est  dans  ce sens  tres large  que  je propose  d'etudier  quelques aspects des  rapports litteraires entre la Suisse romande, le Canada franc;ais et la France.
La  premiere etude  d'envergure qui  ait  ete consacree  au  developpement  paral­ Iele  des  petites  litteratures de  langue  franc;aise est celle  d'Auguste  Viatte. Dans  son  Histoire  litteraire   de  /'Amerique  franfaise,  publiee  en  1954,  Viatte a  trace
!'evolution  des  petites   litteratures d'Haiti, des  Antilles,   de  la  Louisiane, de  la
Nouvelle-Angleterre et du  Canada. Jusqu'ici, aucune etude importante n'a  paru sur les rapports litteraires entre  la Suisse romande et le Canada  franc;ais.
A  premiere vue,  l'etablissement de  rapports etroits  entre la Suisse franc;aise et le Canada, separes  comme  ils le sont  par  la geographie et l'histoire, peut  sembler hasardeux. Pourtant,  un  examen, meme  superficiel  de  leur  litterature,  conduit a de fructueuses decouvertes.
La  Suisse romande partage, avec le Canada fran<_;ais-bien qu'a un  moindre degre -le  meme   sentiment  d'inferiorite  linguistique. Il  peut   paraitre  curieux qu'un pays  qui  ne  fait  qu'un,  linguistiquement parlant, avec  la  France, se sente desavantage dans  l'emploi de  la  langue  commune. L'histoire litteraire nous  ex­ plique   comment les Suisses,  ou  du  moins  certains  d'entre eux,  ont  pu  se  croire defavorises  a cet egard.
Si l'on  remonte au  moyen  age, on s'aper<_;oit qu'a  l'encontre de la Champagne, de  la  Bourgogne,  de  la   Picardie, de  l'Angleterre meme,   qui  devaient  toutes, comme  on  le sait,  produire des litteratures ecrites  en  divers  dialectes apparentes a celui qui  devait  triompher -le fran<_;ais -la Romandie, elle, ne devait  jamais ennoblir par  une litterature ecrite ses patois, qui ont ete largement paries  jusqu'au
r ge  siecle.  Le  premier poete  important issu de  la Suisse  romande est sans  doute
Othon de  Grandson, dont  l'ceuvre  appartient au  14e siecle.  Chaucer aurait  tra­ duit  une  de ses complaintes, aujourd'hui perdue,  en qualifiant le poete  de  "£leur des  poetes  de  France".' Ainsi,  les  premiers  ecrivains  de  la  Suisse  fran<_;aise  ont delaisse leur  patois  pour  s'evertuer a s'exprimer comme  les meilleurs ecrivains  de France.  Reaction  parfaitement  comprehensible si l'on  songe que  la  Suisse fran­
<_;aise  ne  comptera pas  de  ville  importante, c'est-a-dire de  centre  culture! inter­ national avant la  Geneve  de  Calvin. Les ecrivains,  se sentant  isoles, chercheront instinctivement un auditoire au dela de leurs frontieres  nationales.
Pour  des  raisons  toutes  semblables, les ecrivains  canadiens, qui,  de  nos  jours

seulement,  commencent  a  trouver  chez  eux  un  public  relativement   nombreux, ont tourne leurs yeux vers Paris. Cette necessite n'a pas peu contribue  a Ia querelle linguistique,  qui a naturellement  etc beaucoup  plus apre au Canada qu'en  Suisse.


Au CANADA,  les defenseurs  des vocables et expressions au­
tochtones  ont  toujours  etc nombreux,  ainsi que  les esprits conservateurs,  qui ont
preche Ia soumission totale devant I'Academie. En Suisse, Ia querelle, plus feutree, s'est traduite  par le mepris de certains lettres devant Ia pauvrete du vocabulaire romand.
Edmond  Gilliard  est un de ceux-la. Pour  Gilliard,  Ia langue  franc;aise que l'on
apprend   dans  les ecoles de Suisse est une langue  artificielle,  tout  juste bonne  a etre  enseignee  aux  etrangers  qui  frequentent les cours  d'ete  des  universites  de Geneve,  de  Lausanne  et de  Neuchatel.  C'est  pourquoi  Gilliard  a elu domicile a Paris, au ca:ur du monde franc;ais. Avant lui, nombreux  sont les Suisses romands qui  ont  senti  Ia necessite de  prendre le  chemin de  Ia  capitale franc;aise afin d'asseoir  sur  des bases plus solides leur  connaissance  de Ia langue.  Ramuz  nous a raconte  comment  le jeune vaudois qu'il etait, des son arrivee a Paris, a soudain compris  qu'il  parlait  une langue  de province,  assez terne  et appauvrie.  N'est-ce
pas  une  constatation  semblable  que  vient  de faire  a Montreal, M.  Victor  Bar­
beau,  dans  un  numero  du  Devoir,  consacre  precisement  a cette question?  Selon
Barbeau,  Ia  langue  parlee  par  Ia  plupart   des  Canadiens-franc;ais  rend  difficile
a l'ecrivain  le  maniement du  franc;ais, car  entre  Ia langue  ecrite  et  Ia langue
parlee, l'ecart  est trop grand.
Est-il besoin d'ajouter que  je ne fais qu'effieurer  ici un  problt:me linguistique qui  est d'une  grande  complexite?  II va sans dire  qu'on  peut  trouver  des Suisses
et des Canadiens  qui estiment qu'un  long sejour a Paris n'est nullement  necessaire
et peut  meme devenir  prejudiciable  a l'epanouissement de l'ecrivain.  II est clair,
toutefois, qu'en  raison des enormes pressions qu'exerce  le monde  anglo-saxon sur le  Canada  franc;ais, l'ecrivain  canadien   profitera   davantage  que  son  confrere suisse d'un  voyage en France.
Intimement assode  au  problt:me de  Ia langue  est celui  de !'edition  et de  Ia critique.  Selon  que  l'ecrivain  choisit de se faire  publier  chez lui ou a Paris, ses
chances de succes peuvent lui sembler differentes.
L'ecrivain  canadien  ou suisse qui prend  deliberement Ia decision de rester dans son pays, et de courir ses risques a Montreal  ou a Geneve, perd-il grand-chose  a

UNE EPOQUE DE  SYNTHESE



ne  pas  succomber aux  tentations de  Paris?  II faut  distinguer ici deux  situations, qui,  tout en etant defavorables, ne le sont pas au meme degre.
Au  Canada, ecrire  a ete  jusqu'a ces temps  derniers,  une gageure. En  18o4,  un poete desenchante versifiait  ainsi:
Pour nous, dans ce pays ingrat,
Oil !'esprit est plus froid que le climat,
Nos talents sont perdus pour le siecle oil nous sommes.

Depuis  lors,  une  amelioration sensible  a eu  lieu. Les meilleurs  ecrivains bene­ ficient  aujourd'hui d'un appui qui  s'etend, dans  certains cas, bien  au  dela d'une elite dont  les bases ne font  que s'elargir. Fait tres significatif  aussi: grace ala radio  et  a  la  television  nationales, il devient  loisible a  un  nombre  considerable d'ecri­ vains   d'assurer  leur   independance  economique sans  trop  s'eloigner  de  leurs preoccupations litteraires. S'il  est  incontestable que   la  television  risque   parfois d'engloutir les talents, elle offre  a l'ecrivain conscient  du  danger, la possibilite  de ne  la  servir  que  le temps  qu'il  faut,  quitte  a consacrer  ses loisirs considerables a
!'edification de  son  reuvre.  C'est  une  formule qui  n'aurait pas  deplu   a  Balzac,
contraint qu'il  etait, a  une  epoque critique  de sa carriere, de  bacler  des romans qu'il  ne consentit jamais  a signer.  Le nombre de textes  soumis  a la radio  et a la television  canadiennes par  des auteurs franc;ais, belges et suisses, indique que  les cachets  de Radio-Canada  correspondent a un genre de mecenat.
Moins  brillante est  la  situation de  !'edition. Le  public  que  l'ecrivain peut
esperer  toucher ne depasse  guere  les quelque cinq  millions  de Canadiens-franc;ais. La  romanciere Gabrielle Roy  publie  ses reuvres a environ dix  mille  exemplaires. Le  plus  fort  tirage  qu'on ait  jamais  connu  s'est  produit l'an  dernier avec la  pu­
blication  des  Insolences du   frere  untel. Au  mois  de  juin   I g6 I' 1'editeur  avait
ecoule  la plus grande partie des cent vingt et un mille exemplaires de cette analyse humoristique des  insuffisances  intellectuelles du  Canada franc;ais.  Cette   reussite doit  se comparer au  modeste  tirage  de trois mille exemplaires, qui  est une  norme au  Canada franc;ais,  pour  le roman. Cette  norme  represente elle-meme un ideal, puisque  dans la plupart des cas, les invendus  produiront un deficit.

LA SUISSE,  avec  son  unique   million de  francophones,  se trouve dans  l'impossibilite absolue  de faire  vivre ses ecrivains. Tous  les ouvrages
d'auteurs suisses publies  par  les Editions  de la Baconniere ont  ete deficitaires. Les

Editions   Mermod   a  Lausanne,  ou  ont  ete  publiees les  reuvres completes  de Ramuz,  sont dirigees par un industriel eclaire, M. Henry-Louis Mermod.  Depuis une  trentaine  d'annees,  M.  Mermod  lance, avec  un  discemement digne de taus les eloges, les meilleurs poetes de Ia Suisse romande,  dans des editions luxueuses, prometteuses  de pertes financieres. Ne publiant  que  ce qui  lui plait, Ia signature d'Henry-Louis  Mermod   devient  une  garantie   de  qualite.   Mais  interrogez   les poetes qu'il  a fait connai:tre a Lausanne  et a Geneve. Plusiers vous feront  remar­ quer, ne comprenant pas toujours que Lausanne  n'est pas le tremplin qu'est Paris, que leurs reuvres ne circulent pas en France.  La maison Payot, enfin, se consacre depuis  pres  d'un  demi-siecle a !'edition  scolaire  et  scientifique.  Lorsque,  il y a mains  d'un  an,  elle a inaugure  une serie des poetes  romands  en faisant  paraitre deux  plaquettes,  l'une  du  poete  valaisan,  Maurice  Chappaz, et !'autre d'Anne  Perrier,  cette initiative  ressemblait fort a une petite  revolution  dans le monde  de
!'edition  suisse.
Quant a Ia radio  et a Ia television, celles-ci n'offrent  pas les memes debouches qu'au Canada. Par  consequent, les meilleurs ecrivains  du  pays n'y  jouent pas le meme  role et  lorsqu'on  les y trouve,  c'est  pour  constater  que  leur  servitude  est plus grande.
La  situation   materielle  de  l'ecrivain  canadien   etant  precaire  et  celle de  son
homologue  suisse desastreuse, les rapports  entre  critiques  et ecrivains-partout mauvais -atteignent  une  virulence  fort  caracteristiques des petites  litteratures. C'est  une  tentation  a laquelle l'ecrivain  suisse ou  canadien  succombe  facilement que  de croire  que  Ia critique  de son pays l'empeche,  par sa mediocrite,  de  con­ naitre  une  gloire  nationale,  ou  meme  internationale. De son  cote,  le  critique s'impatiente rapidement devant  Ia pauvrete,  veritable  ou imaginaire, de  Ia pro­ duction  litteraire  courante  et se tourne  plus volontiers  vers Paris, ou  ses  talents, croit-il, trouveraient un meilleur emploi.
Depuis  des siecles, Paris exerce une irresistible attraction sur  Ia province fran­
<;aise. Pour  l'ecrivain  ambitieux  etabli  dans  une  capitale  regionale,  le probleme pose par un eventuel demenagement  n'est pas terrible.  II reste toujours  Ia solution intermediaire, qui  permet  de frequentes  navettes  entre  Paris  et le domicile  pro­ vincial, solution devenue courante, grace au train  rapide eta l'avion.
Du moment  que cet ecrivain est de formation  suisse, le probleme se complique. La  solution  parisienne  reste, bien entendu,  possible. Blaise Cendrars -comme, dans  un  tout  autre  domaine,  Le Corbusier-sont des noms qui  sont si  intime­ ment  associes a  Ia  culture  fran<;aise, que  leur  origine  suisse ne se  presente  pas immediatement a !'esprit.  Mais le Suisse romand   a  ete  trop  fortement  marque

so

UNE EPOQUE DE SYNTHESE



par  la  Reforme et  une  v1e politique   autonome pour  ne  pas  reagir,  lorsqu'il  se trouve  en France, en etranger. La  plupart feront  comme  Ramuz, qui,  apres s'etre culturellement complete par  un long sejour  en  France, est retourne sur  les bords du Leman, oil l'attendait sa veritable inspiration.
Mais  c'est  la  que  commence le  drame. Ramuz a  connu   une  celebrite inter­
nationale. Ce  n'est  pas  Lausanne ni  Geneve  qui  lui  ont  confere  la  gloire,  mais Paris.  Les  Suisses,  tres  modestes  lorsqu'il s'agit  de leurs  ecrivains, ont  ete  parmi les  derniers a  s'incliner devant les qualites   exceptionnelles de  l'auteur de  La grande   peur  dans  la  montagne. Du  reste,  Gonzague de  Reynold   n'avait-il pas explique, dans  son  livre sur  Le  doyen  Bridel  et les origines  de la litterature suisse romande qu'il etait  rigoureusement impossible  d'etre a la fois vaudois et ecrivain de genie?
Pour  peu  que  l'ecrivain suisse reflechisse a son sort,  il s'apercevra du  dilemne devant lequel  il se trouve. Rester  chez lui, c'est, a coup sur,  renoncer a etre connu en  dehors  d'un cercle  restreint   de  lecteurs  suisses. Tenter l'aventure parisienne, c'est  risquer, a  peu  d'exception pres,  de  se couper  de  sa source  d'inspiration, la terre  helvetique, qui  seule  peut  foumir la  matiere  de  son  reuvre.  Sans  doute, le choix  ne  se  presente pas  d'une fa on
litteraire parisienne qui  retoumeront plus tard  en Suisse, ayant  compris qu'avant
tout  passe l'authenticite. D'autres, qui seront restes dans le pays natal, se demande­ ront  s'ils n'auraient pas mieux  fait  de partir, pendant qu'il  en etait temps  encore. Ces sentiments, qu'on retrouve dans  tous les pays, ont  ceci de  particulier chez  le Suisse,  qu'ils   refletent   sa  double   nature:  culturellement  influence par   Paris  et politiquement  associe  a  la  Confederation, ce  debat  interieur  definit   un  aspect essentiel de sa spiritualite.

des satisfactions grandissantes d'amour-propre  a Ia courtiser.
L'avenir des litteratures canadienne-franc;aise et romande peut  etre assez claire­ ment  dessine  si on  s'en  tient  uniquement a leur  degre  d'autonomie par  rapport a Paris.
La  Suisse romande me parait destinee  a rester sous Ia dependance culturelle de
Ia France. En  depit  du  fait  que  les cantons de  langue franc;aise  representent un merveilleux capital humain, dont !'equivalent ne se trouve nulle  part  ailleurs  dans les pays  de  langue  franc;aise, ces cantons,  soudes  geographiquement a Ia France, ne  peuvent que  recevoir  des  influences  de  cette  derniere, sans  autre   espoir  lit­ teraire que  de  voir  de  temps  a  autre   un  de  leurs  fils s'imposer a !'attention  du monde  franc;ais par  l'entremise de Paris. Chaque generation produira ses ecrivains du  cru,  dont  les efforts,  plus  ou  moins  inconnus de  l'etranger, constitueront Ia tradition litteraire romande. Les editeurs  et les critiques continueront a se debattre dans  les memes  difficultes,  parce  que  celles-ci  sont  commandees par  Ia faiblesse numerique, economique et politique  de Ia Suisse romande.
Quant a  Ia litterature canadienne-franc;aise, elle est appelee, sans nul  doute, a
s'individualiser de plus en plus. La geographie a elle seule commanderait cette evolution. II serait  anormal qu'un peuple  en pleine  croissance  restat  dans !'imita­ tion.  Toutefois, il n'est  pas a prevoir  que  Montreal affirme  son  independance vis­ a-vis de Paris  comme  New York l'a  fait depuis  longtemps le Londres. Le Canada franc;ais, par son elite, loin de vouloir  refuser le concours de Ia France et des autres  pays de langue  franc;aise, le cherche  d'instinct. Isoles en Amerique, les Canadiens­ franc;ais ne se sentent vraiment libres qu'au sein du monde d'expression franc;aise. Pour  cette  raison,  un double  mouvement est a  prevoir. Au fur et a mesure  que  les ecrivains canadiens exprimeront avec  une  assurance et  une  penetration grandis­ santes   Ia  signification   de  leur  aventure  franc;aise  et  americaine, les liens  qu'ils  forgeront avec  !'Europe de  langue  franc;aise  se  ressereront. Nombreux sont  les auteurs  canadiens  qui  se  font   maintenant  editer   simultanement a  Paris   et  a Montreal.
II semble  qu'au dela  de  toutes  les difficultes  d'ordre psychologique,  economi­ que  ou  autre, qu'eprouvent Suisses  romands et  Canadiens dans  leur  commun effort  pour  s'exprimer litterairement, il se forge,  par  une  logique qui est propre a notre   temps,   une  solidarite   entre  les  hommes. Dans   cette  perspective, les mots dependance  et independance  n'ont  peut-etre pas  tout  le  poids  qu'on leur  assigne normalement. Manifestement, c'est vers une interdependance que  nous marchons. Les  Canadiens et  les Suisses, pour  Ia  premiere fois, font  Ia decouverte mutuelle de leurs ecrivains. Dans ce processus, Ia France n'est  pas absente.

LETTER FROM  TORONTO

Robert McCormack

Overheard  on  a  bus  (One very  well­ dressed  young  lady  discussing   the  latest literary sensation with  an   older   but  equally  well-dressed  companion): "It was a  paperback   in  New   York   but   George wouldn't let me ... I  mean  he said they'd  just take  it  away  at  the  border  anyway. Is it  really ... ? I  read  in  Horizon,  you know   this  very   highbrow   exotic   maga­ zine, it  said the  style  was  ... you know, like   Ulysses- you    can   hardly    under­ stand it it's so obtuse."



T.s IS THE soRT of incident writm  teport to  one  anothe< with  a  sardonic smile  and  a  sad  shake  of the  head,  and  no  doubt that  is all it is worth. Poor  old  Henry   Miller,  poor  old  everybody.  If I have  been  brooding about it occasionally in the two or three  days since it happened, it is only because it  reminded  me  of  some  earlier   brooding I was  propelled   into  by  last  May's Canadian Conference of the Arts. I am thinking of the audience at this landmark in  our  cultural history,  an  audience which  was,  or  seemed  to  be,  very  largely composed   of  my  bus-companion  and   her  friends.  There they  were  with   their mink   stoles,   knock-'em-dead  hats   and   reluctant  husbands,  drifting  sluggishly through and   about the  lavish  new  O'Keefe Centre, gaping and   poking  at  the exhibition of painting and  sculpture in  the  lobby  and  registering  various  combi­ nations of  anxiety, bewilderment and  boredom as they sat  through the  concerts,  speeches  and  panel  discussions.  There were  others in  the  crowd  too,  of  course - artists,  critics,  collectors,   publishers, C.B.C. officials and  the  inevitable little  old ladies  in  sneakers. But  it  was  young  Mrs.  Malaprop and  her  associates  who  set the  dominant tone.  And,  as you will have  noticed  long  ago, it  was a tone  which

53

LETTER FROM TORONTO



caused   the  greatest   outbreak of sardonic smiles  and  headshakings in  years.  Yet the  two  things  that  most impressed  me about  these  people  were  neither  especially comic  nor  altogether pathetic. In  the first place,  prominent in the incredible mix­ ture  of  motives  that  had  brought them  there  was  an  obvious  and   honest  hope of enlightenment. In  the second,  there  was the  tolerant and  self-critical  patience with  which  they  bore  the  abuse.  For  they  were  abused. Elegant young  painters sneered   at   them,   witty  young   professors  berated  them,   angry   young  novelists denounced  them,   handsome  young   poets  read   them   verse  of  such  unabashed sexuality  as to turn  them  to stone  on the spot,  and, finally,  the American culture expert Russell  Lynes told  his whole  audience that  they should  abolish  themselves forthwith.
It would   be  idle  to deny  that  there  was  something satisfying  about this  per­ formance of  "The Triumph of  Ariel,  or  The Artist's  Revenge."  Knocking the bourgeoisie about  has  been  excellent  sport  these  three  hundred  years  and  it still pleases.  But  there  semed  to  me something a little  extravagant  about the  drama at  the  O'Keefe, even  a  bit silly. It was  Mr.  Lynes'  thesis  that  if those  he called the   "tastemakers" and   the  "culturettes" would   only  stop  bothering the  artist,  would   just  quietly  vanish  and  leave  him  alone,  the  artist  would  then  be free  to create a  new,  more  intelligible  art  for a  broader, less fashion-ridden public.  But surely  this  is simply  a variation on  the  familiar  theory  that  somewhere out  there in  vast  America, beyond  the  critics  and   the  ladies'  committees, there  exists  a larger, more  genuine public  of  ten  million  honest   working-men ready  to  snap  up  modern art  by the warehouseful if only it could  be properly presented to them. This  is pure  fantasy. By and  large,  the audience for contemporary painting, music and   writing   was  pretty  exactly  represented by  the  audience at  the  Conference. These  are  the  people  who are interested in art,  who  have  the leisure  to pursue  it, and  the  money  to  pay  for  it.  Certainly they  are  an  audience which  could  stand  a great  deal  of improvement,  but  this is hardly a reason  for  wishing  they  would drop   dead. On   the  contrary,  more  and  better   "tastemakers" and  "culturettes" would  seem  to  be precisely  what  we need,  and  especially  is this  true  in  the  case of literature.




ONE OF   THE many  things  that  used  to enrage Ezra  Pound in  the  days  when  he was European editor  of Poetry  was the sentence from  Whit­ man   which  Harriet Monroe  insisted  on  keeping as  the  magazine's  motto: "To

54

LETTER FROM TORONTO



have  great   poets  there   must  be  great  audiences too."  Considering what  Pound was  up  to  at  the  time,  his  reaction   is understandable. And   there  is a  perfectly valid  sense in  which,  to  a writer  actually  engaged  in  writing, the  audience (any audience) is simply  irrelevant. Nevertheless,  Miss Monroe was probably right  to cling  to  her  somewhat tattered motto.  There can  be  no  prescription for  genius, but  the  production of a generally  high level of writing  (which makes the appear­ ance  of  genius  considerably more  likely)  does seem  to  require a  community of author and   audience in  which   there  is a  real  and  useful  interchange between  them.   When   there   is  no  such  community, when  there  is  no  agreement about values  or  standards,  no  intelligible communication  on  the one  hand   and  no meaningful  feedback  on  the  other,   there  is only  a  chaos  equally   damaging to writer  and  reader. In  short, there  is the situation we have  here  at  the moment.
It is  a  situation-to  take  a  minor  example-  in  which   three  of  the  local
reviews of Morley  Callaghan's latest novel, A Passion in Rome, differed  so wildly in approach and  interpretation that  they might  very easily have  been  about  three different books. No  reasonable reader  would  expect  three  critics to agree  entirely, and  I suppose  it might  even  be argued  that  violently conflicting notices  are really a tribute to  the  complexity of the  work  in question. I am  afraid, however,  that what  we have  here  is simply  the  kind  of reviewing  long  ago  described  by Henry James as  "an   unprecented  invention for  darkening counsel". It confounds the reader and   it  would   be  surprising if  it  did  not  make  the  writer  cynical  about all  criticism   whatever. No  doubt   Mr.  Callaghan can  look  after  himself  by this time.  But  the  rest  of  us are  left  inhabiting a literary   desert  where  it is only  too likely that  both  author and  audience will either  rush  panting after  every fashion­ able mirage  or else collapse limply into the few small, dusty oases.
One  of these is, of course,  the  university.  But  the University of Toronto (York University is too  new  to  have  made  any  distinct  impression)  has  never  had  the tradition  of  a  community  service  or  involvement  which   characterizes certain American state  universities and  municipal colleges. Its lineage  is undeviatingly aristocratic and  its  goal  remains the  self-enclosed  "community of scholars." To an  outsider, it sometimes seems  to be full of young  instructors who  refuse  to buy television  sets  "on   principle," and  experts  in  American literature to  whom  one has  to explain   who  Saul  Bellow is. This  is not  a criticism; it is conceivable that some  acquaintance with  contemporary life  and  literature might  be  useful  to  a scholar  but  it is not  a necessity. It is not  even strictly  true,  for one  has no sooner set  it  down   than   one  thinks  of  Northrop Frye,  or  Marshall McLuhan, or  the editor  of The  Canadian Forum, Milton  Wilson. Still, I think  it is fair  to say that

55

LETTER FROM TORONTO



the  University  as such is not much  of a force in literary  affairs. It  is significant that  the  "Letters in  Canada" section of  the  University   of  Toronto   Quarterly, which  contains  some of the  best criticism of  our  writing  to appear  anywhere, comes out too rarely and has too limited a circulation  to have much influence.



IT IS  PERHAPS  also significant  that   the  University  seems  to have so little effect on its recent graduates, or even on its undergraduates. One of the former -a shining new B.A. in "Eng.  Lang.  & Lit." -remarked to me the
other  day  that  his whole aim in college had  been to get the degree and  get out so he could at last "learn  how to write". It did  not seem to occur to him that  he might  possibly have  learned  something  about  it  from  his courses.  ("Symbols," he said, "they were always talking about symbols. You know, I don't  think George Eliot knew  a  damn  thing about  symbols.")  These  people  huddle  around  a few coffee-houses, the  Isaacs Gallery  (where  there  are  regular  poetry  readings)   and various ephemeral  publications. In general, their writing is characterized  by with­ drawal  from  or  rejection  of the society around them -lyrical evocation  of the Never-Never  or sluggish nightmares  of violence.  In  a  city where  a  department store  displays Franny  and  Zooey  among  the  children's books, and  where guests at an  apparently somewhat  bohemian  party  are  dragged  off to jail and  the men are sprayed with delousing fluid  while the girls are subjected  to vaginal examina­  tions,  such  reactions  are  understandable. But  they  are,  of   course,  social,  not literary,  reactions. Artistically, there is nothing solid enough for les jeunes to react to or  rebel against.  The  result is a constant  danger  of  relapse into  tired experi­ ments in Kerouackery  or Ginsbergese. This tendency the more or less avant-garde magazine  Evidence  (which has, incidentally,  under the editorship of Alan Bevan, produced  a third  issue much superior  to the first  two numbers) has felt it neces­ sary  to  condemn  in  an  oddly  old-fashioned  editorial:  "Attacking decadence  in forms which themselves constitute a decay or corruption of language and thought,  and  are  therefore  equally  as deplorable  as  the  things  they  attack,  is the surest way to commit artistic suicide."
There remains  only a kind  of "shadow-establishment" which probably  is the centre  (except it is not a centre)  of whatever literary life there is here. The names of  this scattering   (it  is certainly  not  a group)  of writers,  critics and  editors­ Robert  Fulford  of the Toronto  Star  (surely the best book columnist on the conti­ nent), the editors of Tamarack  Review, Kildare  Dobbs of Saturday Night, etc.-

LETTER FROM TORONTO



appear with  such  regularity in  so many  places  that  it  would  not  take  a  very advanced case of paranoia to believe they formed some kind of literary  cabal. Unfortunately, this  is not  the  case. The  real  charge  to  be  made  against  them  is that  they remain too divided  and  weak  to establish  any consistent  standards or to give  any  real  sense of direction. Readers are left to their  own  confused  resources, and,  lost among the  squares, writers  are  only  too likely to become  quite  literally "obtuse".

MONSTER CHARACTERS

Barrie Hale



Ten for Wednesday Night, ed. Robert  Weaver. McClelland & Stewart Ltd.


Ten   for Wednesday  Night  is an  anthology of  Canadian short  stories. That is, the  authors of them  live here, or were  born  here,  or  came  here  to live for a -while, and   all  the  stories   have  been read on C.B.C. Wednesday Night.  Aside from   these  near-accidents, they  are  uni­ fied by no specific "Canadianism". There is,  however,   a  curious   unity  of   another sort   presented  by  most  of  the Ten; a unity of structure.
There are  many  structural  possibilities for  the  short  story;   only one  of  them  is that   which  evolves  when  one  character, or  a  characterized  circumstance, is  felt with   such   preternatural  potency   as  to sweep  aside  all  other  characters present
-mere mean  human beings. In  one way or  another, all  but  one  of  the  Ten  are built  around this sort of Monster Charac­ ter-infinitely  and  inexplicably  greater than   the  sum  of  its  causation  or  moti­  vation;  the   major   exception  is  Brian Moore's  "Off    the   Track",  a   story   of situation.
Jack  Ludwig's "Requiem for Bibul" creates perhaps  the  largest  character  in the  anthology; Bibul  is of  pre-war  Win­ nipeg,   and   for   a   while   the  sprawling,
 conglomerate city and  the slum-gutter future Rabbi are  giants  sufficiently  large to be mutually sympathetic. But  the Requiem never  really  makes  up  its mind to  cry  for  Winnipeg past  or  Bibul  dead; it  tries   ultimately  to  make  Siamese   the pair  and   cry  for  both,  but  Bibul's  enor­ mously scornful  "Aaaa"  has  already swept   aside   Old   Winnipeg and  his  de­ parture from  it.  Bibul's  "Aaaa" has  even swept   aside   his  own   gratuitous   death; Ludwig's final  lament  for  gone  city  and dead   citizen   leaves  one  wanting a  final goatily-negative  "Aaaa", for  Bibul  the World-disdainer  is finally  a character too large  for  materialist  Winnipeg, and  even extravagant Ludwig.
Mordecai Richler's "The Summer My
Grandmother  Was  Supposed  to  Die"  is certainly as  good  a  story,  but  flawed  in the  same  way;   there   is  a  great   sense  of loss  present, but  "what exactly  is lost?" and  "how  is the  loss felt?" are  questions which   occus   to  one   at  the  end   of  the narrative. As a  narrative, the  setting-out of   the   process   of  adolescent   guilt,   the story  is  chillingly   effective; at  the  same time,   it  is  curiously   unsatisfactory  as  a resolution of  its  two  major ingredients:

past Hebraic magnificence, and the mordant Yiddish  present. In  the  present, there  is the  Rabbi who  asks, "Well  boys, what  do  you  want  to  be when  you grow up?" before   his  mother is  cold,  and   in
the   past   a   J ewishness  so  proud    that
Catholic priests  attended its funerals. Be­
tween   the   great    past   of  Grandmother and   the  poor   present of  her  adolescent grandson there  is neither communication nor   continuity;  against   the   magnificent and  unknowable past  that   Grandmother represents,  there   is  only  the   poor  blind present   of  Process.  "Did   you  know  that when   they  hang   a  man," says  the  older brother  of  the   narrator, "the last  thing that  happens is that  he has  an  orgasm?" Within the  framework imposed  by the preternatural protagonist,  Ludwig and Richler are  certainly the  most  successful (though certainly not entirely successful) of  the  Ten in  creating a  satisfying  short structure. There is one  story  represented here  that  is completely satisfactory, struc­ turally: Brian  Moore's "Off  the Track", a   "situation  story",   and,   as   such,   the maverick of the  anthology. Two emanci­ pated   Toronto  suburbanites go  to  Haiti to  discover   the  real,  untouristy  people; they   do,  and   discover   as  well  that   the real   people  are  not  at  all  interested  in them,    their   emancipation,  or   their   re­ actions to  their   unexpected  discoveries. They   are   left   searching  their   imagina­ tions  for  future  superficial anecdotes to balance   their  past superficial  expecta­ tions,   and   so  is  the   reader;  as  if  the future  anecdote were  in  fact  the  present narrative, the  style is weirdly  shallow  and bloodless,  failing   entirely  to  exploit   the possibilities   of  the   situation.  And,   to  a greater or  less extent, this  is the  fault  of the  remaining seven  of Ten for W ednes­ day   Night.  Though,  unlike   Off  the
 Track, they  deal  with  giant  protagonists, like it they are  unable to match adequate theme  with adequate style; they are consequently structurally inadequate.
Perhaps  the   most   indicative  of   this
inadequacy  is  Gabrielle  Roy's   "Grand­ mother and  the Doll"  (published here  in translation). It is not a story at  all, but a character study; the narrative of the doll construction does  not  produce story  pro­ gression  but  simply   character  encrusta­ tion. Because Grandmother is seen against no  background  but   that   of  her  present,  she   even  diminishes  from   character  to type; in the  face  of something as immut­ able  as Type  the  narrator is  able only to say. "Isn't she wonderful?" in endless and  helplessly saccharine  variations.  The Grandmother in   Alice   Monro's  "The Trip to  the  Coast"  lives  a  powerful life as a character  by  way of contrast, but  is featured by the same  defining  character­ istics-a  rigid  hold  on  a  present  that  is composed  of  equal parts  of nostalgia for the  past and  incomprehensible dreams  of the  future.  But what  makes  Character of Alice  Monro's Grandmother,  as  distinct from  Gabrielle  Roy's   Type, is  that   she child  through whose  eyes we see her  is a character in  her  own  right,   albeit  com­ pletely  dominated by Grandmother. This domination   is   ultimately  what   destroys the   story,  for   when   Grandmother  dies, so does  her  unaccountable dream of  the future  "Trip  to  the  Coast," so does  her ineffable   past; we  are  left  with  a  child out  of  whose  life  the  present  has  gone. In  Mordecai Richler's account of a simi­ lar  death  we were  at  least  left with some sort  of  present   to  go on  with,  a  present from   which   the   past  might  at  least  be seen, if not  known.

as the  coming  together  of circumstances, which  possess awfully  vital but essentially unknowable personalities, within  the lives of a group of human beings, who possess no  personalities other  than   the  negative ones  of  reaction-to-circumstances. Ethel Wilson's   "From  Flores"  brings  together three   unknowable  personalities-Rock, Sky,  Sea -and  six  human   cyphers -a pompous-but-likable  white,    his   similar wife,  a  brutish white,  a  pitiable  white,  a doomed-to-death  Indian  child,   and   his doomed-to-despair  father.    The    human characters  are   neat   and   pat,   but   there is nothing neat  and  pat  about  Rock,  Sky and   Sea;  when   the   three   combine   as storm,  humanity  is   helpless  and   is destroyed, simply  and   completely.  But such    completeness  is  flat;    perhaps  it would   have   been  less so  had  humanity been   sketched   a  little   less  simply,   and with   at   least   as  many   rough   edges  as Rock,  Sky and  Sea. Similarly,  in Gordon Woodward's "Tiger! Tiger!" the  human characters begin  as  familiar, if  minute, human beings-the  self-repressed   spin­ sters  whose  parent's past  looms far  larger than    their   present,  the   retarded   ado­ lescent   whose  child's mind  fails  to  cope with   his   adult  drives,   the   bizarre   and  mysterious visitor.  All  are  quickly  trans­  figured  by an orgasm of blood-lust, blood­ greed,  blood-hate; the  catalyst  turns  out to be the central and  most potent charac­ ter of all -the stranger's side-show tiger. It  is  as   powerfully   sensual   a  story   as "From   Flores",    and   poses   the    same conundrum:  if   the  central character  in a  short   story  of   character  is  essentially unknowable  by  nature, how  may  such  a story  be  written  satisfactorily?
Perhaps the  most   disappointing  story of  the  Ten is  Morley  Callaghan's "The Doctor's Son"; it appears to be a portrait

6o
 of  that  familiar figure  from  the  world  of larg,er-than-life,  the   small town doctor who, Godlike, is all  things  to all men, especially   to  the   young,   who  have   not yet  lost  their  capacity to belief.  The dis­ appointment occurs  quickly as small town takes  over  from   Doctor God -Morton loses  the  faith   of  his  only  begotten  son less through the  stresses of  Omnipotence and  Benevolence than  through a series of personal   and    social   misadjustments  so elementary that  we  are unable to believe that   he  could  ever  have  legitimately at­  tained  to the eminence we are  assured  he possessed.
This  agonizing state   of  affairs  unfor­ tunately characterizes Ten   for  W ednes­ day   Night,·   scarce   fountainhead  erupts that   does  not  turn  arid   before  reaching the  sea.

THESE   THREE slim   volumes do  not  belong  to  the  realms  of  creative or   imaginative literature  or   of  literary history   or   criticism.  Basically,   they  fall within   those   other  realms-sociology, history,  politics,  and  economics. Yet each, in  varying  degrees,  comments on  certain aspects   of   Canadian  culture  and   each tries  to  give  some  body   to  that   vague, floating, spiritual substance -the  Cana­ dian.  As such,  these  volumes  are of inter­  est   to   those   of   us  who   would   like  to know   who   we  are   and   where   we  are  going.
After  a  first  quick  reading of  the  text I could  find  no  more   appropriate  com­ ment    than    these   three    lines   from  the wisdom   of  Omar  Khayyam. I  had
... heard great argument
About it  and  about; but  evermore
Came out  by  the same  door  where in I went.
My  mood   was  prompted, in  part,   by my  own  inability  to  define   "Canadian" and,  in  part, by  the  nature of  the  three books.  Though  now   encased  in  covers, each  volume  was  originally conceived   as a series of public  lectures or conference addresses.  All, as a result,  though at times stimulating  and   provocative,  stay  close to  the  troubled surface of  the  matter in hand. None  fully  develops an  argument or  a  theme; none   plunges into  any  un­ explored depths.
Of   the   three   works   Professor   Falar­
deau's is  the  most  invigorating and   the
 most  refreshing. Originally  given  as  two of  the  Plaunt Memorial Lectures at Carleton University in Ottawa in March
1g6o, the  book  is slight  in  bulk  but  rich in   ideas.   Born   and   reared  a   French­ Canadian  and   trained  as  a   sociologist, M.   Falardeau  moves with   sure step across  the  whole  Canadian  scene.  He  is that   rare   Canadian-one   who   under­ stands   and   appreciates   the   duality    of Canadian culture,   with   all   its   many faceted   complexities. But  he  arrived  at his  present   happy   position  only  after   a slow and  at  times a painful journey.  In  a frank   and   a   patently  honest    autobio­ graphical  sketch  he  traces   the  principal stages  of   that   journey -from his  birth  in  Quebec  City  down  to  the  day  in 1948 when  he first  read  the  marvellous letters of Frank   Pickersgill.
As  a  young   child   in  Canada's  most historic  city  he  was  unaware of  the English-speaking  "self-segregated  minor­ ity".  For  him  they  had  no  existence.  His first  "blurred recollection  of  reference  to les  Anglais   can   be   traced   to   a   lesson in   Canadian   history   in   the   parochial school."  The  English  were  to  be  hated for   the   deportation   des   Acadiens.  Not until  he  moved   to  Montreal as  an  ado­  lescent  did  he  begin  to  feel  the  impact of  English  Canada; but   even   then   the "...

had   approved  the   Canadian   participa­ tion  in  the  Boer  War,  and  had  imposed conscription in  I 9 17."
Later, as  an  undergraduate, he  began
to  meet  students from  McGill,  Toronto, Manitoba;  began,   too,  to  read   English books-one of which, The  Pickersgill Letters, brought to him  a sense of union with  the  "other" Canadians he had never before felt. Through the reading of these letters   that    the   indomitable   Pickersgill left  as  a  precious gift  to  all  Canadians "I  discovered . . . that  the  philosophical and   moral   questions which  were  almost the  obsession  of my French-Canadian friends had  also  tormented, without our knowing it, some of our English-speaking compatriots of the same  generation." Without our knowing it-this was, and perhaps still  is,  the  tragedy  inherent  in the  duality of Canadian life.  The  Falar-
 deaus  did  not  know  the  Pickersgills,  nor the   Pickersgills   the   Falardeaus-"such was   the   thickness   of  silence,  such   was the   psychological  distance  between    us, English  and  French-speaking Canadians." With   a  particular  personal   sorrow,   I can  feel   the   undertones  of  sadness   in M.  Falardeau's  testament of  youth.   For I, too, was born  and  raised  in  Quebec­ the  province, not  the  city. My  childhood town    was   Sherbrooke-an    active   in­  dustrial  centre in  the  eastern   townships. As  a  family   we  belonged   to  the   "self­ segregated minority".  As such,  we  lived in  isolation  in   the   North  Ward,  where few  French-Canadians were  even   to  be seen  in  those  days.  The school  to  which I went  came  under the  Protestant School Board,    and   the   history   of  Canada  we studied  (and  study   it   we  did-dates and  all in great  detail)  was written from

the   English   point   of   view-though I do   not   recall   that   it  encouraged  us  to despise   the   French-Canadians  for   any insurrections or  rebellions.   We  read  the English-language paper,  the  S her brooke Record; we  shopped in  stores  owned  by English-speaking Canadians;  and   we were  brought  up  in  the  Protestant  tra­ dition. In  brief,  though we  did  not  dis­ like  the   French-Canadians and   though we  were  not  unaware of  their  existence,  we  never   got   to  know   them.   I  cannot recall  now  that   there   was  any  conscious hostility   between   us,  except   during  the conscription crisis of I gI 7,  when,  on one memorable evening a violent riot erupted on   Wellington    Street-but    even   this riot  ended  in  a  somewhat amicable way, with   the   English-speaking  Canadians singing  "God Save  the  King" with  great  fervour  at  one  end  of the  street,  and  the French-Canadians  giving   a  full-hearted rendition  of  "0  Canada" at  the  other. But  like  M.  Falardeau, I, too,  lived  in the   "thickness  of  silence". Because  of this,  I am   less  Canadian  than   I might have   been  if  I had   passed   my  Quebec youth   in   the   atmosphere  of  congenial understanding  that    M.   Falardeau   en­ visions as a possibility.
The  rapprochement, he  says, is at  the moment "particularly  visible  in  the  aca­ demic   world".  Though  Canadian  intel­ lectuals  are  becoming "...  more  aware of   their   respective  spiritual  heritages," they   are   also  seeing   more   clearly   than ever   before   that   behind  the   duality   of Canadian culture is a common  source­ classical  humanism. To re-examine, then,  the   roots  of   humanism,  and ". . .  to ascertain  some  of  its  subsequent acquisi­  tions   may   be  one   of  the   most   fruitful ways   of  finding  our   common  denomi­ nator."
 But  this  re-examination of  humanism and   its  subsequent  acquisitions  will   be by  no  means  a  simple  task.  Only  within the universities can it be undertaken with any hope  of success. The avenues  of approach   must    be   intellectual  rather than   political, and   "the creative  poten­ tialities  of  classical  humanism"  must   be "rejuvenated  by  the   broad   perspectives of   the   social   sciences"    if    we   are   to achieve  any  solid  "fusion" of  our  "dual cultural  heritages."  Here,   I   believe, M. Falardeau runs  head  on into semantic difficulties,  for  by  "fusion"  he  does  not mean   a  melting  or   a   blending  of  the  two  cultures into  one.  On   this  point   he is adamant. The two cultures may  enrich each  other,  but  neither culture must  ab­  sorb  or  even   radically  alter   the   other. "Whatever  the  rapprochement  may  be, it   will   have   to  rest,  it   will  be  all   the stronger  if  it  rests,  on  the  recognition of duality  ... Un-hyphenated  canadianism is a  fiction." This  is a bi-cultural country. We  are   twins;   and   if  we  are   to  make  our   way   successfully   in   this   complex world  we must  recognize  this  twinship.
I  might   add   that    M.   Falardeau,  to make  assurance doubly  sure,  states  firmly that   he  is  in   no  sense  of  the   word   a separatist.  Though  a   French-Canadian (and  as such  a "charter member" of Canada), he pleads  with all his fellow Canadians "to  accept Canada in its wholeness  ... as an  act  of reason." And he  would   have   a  strong   and   a  unified Canada stand   before  all  the  nations of the  world  as an  example of what  can  be done   through  understanding,  tolerance, and  co-operation.

We  should now  give  to  ourselves, and  to others, the   image of  a  people whose  ambi­ tion  is  not   so  much to  reach  the  moon, as

Professor Morton's  The  Canadian
Identity,  like   M.   Falardeau's  work,   is based  upon  a series of public addresses­ the  first  three  given  at  the  University  of Wisconsin  in  r 959-60,  the  fourth, before the   Canadian  Historical   Association   at Queen's   University  in   June,  rg6o.   Of the   first   three   lectures   I   can   say  little here.   Each   is a  polished  historical   essay
-condensed, well filled with facts, dates, and  names,  with  a sprinkling of  specula­ tion  and  reflection   to  add  savour  to  the dish.   The   chapter   titles   indicate  the contents:  "Canada  in  America"; "Can­ ada   in   the   Commonwealth";  "Canada and  the  United States." Only  in  the  last lecture,   "The  Relevance of   Canadian History," does Mr.  Morton touch directly  upon  some  aspects   of  the  arts  in  Can­ ada.  Here we are  told  that  in  Canadian art  and  literature are  certain "distinctive qualities engendered by the experience of northern life"-tendencies to "the heroic   and   the   epic,   to  the   art   which deals   with   violence" - to  which   may be  added  the  satiric,   "for   northern  life is  moral   or  puritanical, being  so  harsh that   life  can   allow   little   laxity  in  con­ vention."  And   "the  moral   affords   the substance and  creates the  disposition  for satire." But  surely  such  statements were intended  to  be  provocative rather  than  informative.  They  add   nothing  to  our understanding  of  the  Canadian  arts   at large,   nor   do  they  bear  close  examina­ tion  when  looked  at  in the light of world literature.

The  Price  of  Being  a  Canadian is  a
conference  r1:1port and   suffers  from   all
 the   shortcomings  of  its  kind.   As  a   re­ fresher  book  for   those  who  were  fortu­ nate  enough  to   attend  the   Seventh Winter Conference of  the  Canadian In­ stitute on  Public   Affairs  it  undoubtedly has  its  real   values,   but  for   the  general reader  the   offering    is   slight.   Of   most interest to the  readers of  Canadian Liter­ ature  will  be the  few  pages on  Canadian culture  contributed   by  Hugh  MacLen­ nan.   Closely  allied   to  M.  Falardeau  in outlook   and  in  feeling   (if  not  in  profes­ sional   activity),   Mr.    MacLennan  sees Canada   whole-with its  harshness, its neuroses,   its   racial   complexities-and, while    recognizing   the    limiting  factors around him,  would   not  change his  lot.

I believe  it  real  and accurate to say  that we  can   contribute a  very  great deal to  the world if Canada remains Canadian. Cultur­ ally   we  can   contribute,  and   politically  we
can   contribute. If two  centuries have  pro­ duced  such   a   nation  as  ours,   now   is  not  the   time   to   give   it   up,   for   it   was   never really   needed  before now.

Have I  really  come  out  by  the  same door   where    in   I  went?    Perhaps  not. True, none  of these books gives a clear definition of  the  word   "Canadian",  but each  one,  in  its  own  way, is an  affirma­ tion  of faith  in  Canada. It may  be wiser to  make  no  attempt to  define  the word.  For  being  a  Canadian  may  mean  simply the  feeling   of  belonging in  and   to  Can­ ada,  of  believing   in  the  whole  Canada, with  its  basic  duality of  cultures and   a multitude  of  other   cultures  within  the basic  two.  Not  all  of   us can  understand all  of  its  complexities and  neuroses.  But at  least  we can  profit  from  the  words  of all  the  Falardeaus and  the  MacLennans who are struggling to dissipate  the  thick­ ness of  silence  and  to  bridge  the  psycho­ logical   distance  that   too  often   keep   us apart-one  from  the  other.







A POETRY  OF CELEBRATION

Beyond    the   High  Hills:  A   Book   of  Eskimo Poems. Translated  by  Knud Rasmussen. Photographs by  Guy  Mary-Rousseliere.  Nel­ son  Foster and  Scott. $4·75·

KNuo RASMUSSEN, the  Danish explorer, collected   these  poems  among the  Iglulik Eskimos  of  the  Hudson Bay  region  and the    Musk    Ox   people    of   the   Copper Country.  A  prefatory  note   tells  us  this and  the  photographs supply  atmosphere, fact   and   'feel'   in  the  most  rapid,  vivid way.  A girl  with  white  bone  bracelets  in her  hair  kneels on shingle, slicing orange­ and-silver fillets  from  an  unrecognisable carcass.  A  young  caribou  lies  dead  on  a confetti of  tiny  vermilion  flowers  which have   prodded  up   from   the   moss;   its underbelly is mauve and  its rear  legs re­ semble  two  rifles  with  velvet  stocks.  An old  man  and   an  old  woman   sitting  side by   side   outstare   the   camera:   faces striated as  old   rocks,  dark   eyes  slotted deeply   and  safely  under   the  brow,  hair  like  wire,  hands  immobile and   scarred. White   scarps    of   ice   bulge    against    a purple  sky  like  bed-sheets  hung   out   to dry.  A weatherworn child  kisses a puppy. Other   children  toy  with   yellow  pencils and   simper.   Four  men    haul  a   dead, cream-furred  bear   across   the   ice.  In   a violent-looking, violet  mineral world  two girls  rub  noses;  a  plump  bird  tilts  over slightly,  away  from  its mate; and  a dead walrus's   tusks  suggest   the   opened  beak
 of some pachyderm, obese bird.  Nearly everyone  grins  and  squints.
These are the details which the poems vaguely evoke and which, of course, the Eskimo  can  supply  for  himself.  Without such  details   we  ourselves  could   squeeze little  from  or  into
Glorious it  is
To  see the  long-haired winter caribou
Returning to  the  forests
or  respond  fully  to such  a question as
Know you  the  smell Of  pots on  the  boil? And  lumps  of blubber
Slapped down by the  sidebench?
There are no colours  in  these  poems, few explanations of the  natural world's texture and   few  visual  images.  Essenti­ ally,  Eskimo   poetry   is  terse,  narrative­ exclamatory and  ingenuously  direct:
Joyfully
Greet we  those
Who  brought us plenty!
It is  only  rarely   that   the   poets  amplify by  saying,   for   example,  that    a  walrus "set   its  flippers   angrily   Like   elbows  on the  surface  of  the  water" or  that  a  bear "came  running  towards  me   gladly,   So eager  it  was  to  eat  me  up  on  the  spot". Oral tradition has produced here  a strict shorthand, an   unfancy   texture, so  that the  occasional   vivid  but  merely  denota­ tive image  gains an extraordinary power:
But  else I choke with  fear At greedy  maggot throngs; Thy
At  the  bottom of my collarbone
And  in my eyes.
As Knud  Rasmussen pointed out, the Eskimo   language  has   no  word   for   'in­ spiration' but  uses a simple  phrase mean­ ing  'to  feel  emotion'. So  all  are  poets;  the   poetry   is   exoteric   and   communal. These  poems have  no one author, parade no idiosyncrasy  but, instead, distill  ethnic experience into   explicit   little   outbursts

 which  have  both  the  naivety  of  nursery­ rhyme  and  the  sophisticated  economy  of haiku. The  Eskimo   poem   does   not   so much    attempt   revelations   as  celebrate whatever is at  hand:
I will walk with leg muscles which  are  strong
as the  sinews  of  the  shins  of the  little  cari- bou  calf.
I will walk with leg muscles which  are  strong
as the  sinews of  the  shins  of the  little  hare.
The point   here   is  oneness  with   nature, not  truth through apt  comparisons. It is an  unintellectual approach and   a  brac­ ing   change.  Read  alongside the  photo­ graphs, the  poems  prove  again and  again  that   moving   poetry  does  not  have  to  be metaphorical or  figurative,  that   a  com­ munity's habitual  ways  are  always  alle­ gorical  and   that  poetry  is an  art  of con­ text.   For   instance,   when   a  girl   in   the snow-wastes  says,
Bring  hither  your wooden  ornament, I will deck myself with it,
To  make me look like a real woman
her  setting gives  the  utterance enormous power.   I  just   wish   the   book   included many  more  poems  so  that  one  could  try getting a sense of the  Eskimo  world  from the   poems'    insistences  alone,    and   not from   photographs.  But   then,   whatever way  we  adopt, to  encounter that   world is an  extension of our  own  living.
Iwish  too  that   Eskimo  poetry  ampli­ fied  for  us  the  fine  discrimination  which creates different Eskimo  words  for differ­  ent  kinds  of  snow  and  for  the  successive stages  of a  bear's  growth. This close look is missing from  the  poems.  Fine  discrimi­ nation,  for  them, is a  pragmatic matter; for   us,   art   and    casuistry.  When   they celebrate they cerebrate least;  when  we celebrate we split  hairs.  But  their  poems are    sung   and    danced  and    acted    re-

peatedly during long  nights  which  would drive   our   own   poets   into   endless,   des­ perate phantasmagoria.
This  book confronts us, then,  with  the difference between   the   sung  and   the spoken,   the   oral   and   the   written  and, above  all, 'dance-house' and  poet's  tower. It is  good   to  meet   a  poetry   treasured equally   by  all  who  inherit  the  original language.  But    surely    this    is   a   mere sample,  and  there  is much  more  to come. I  hope   it   will  come   soon,  even   if  we have   to  have   it   without  colour  photo­ graphs of  the  kind  which  dominate this elegant, thin  volume. 	PAUL WEST

SIPPED AND SAVOURED

ETHEL  WILSON.  Mrs.  Golightly  and    other stories.    Macmillan  Company   of  Canada.
$3-50.

THE TITLE OF  Ethel Wilson's latest publi­ cation is  misleading, since   the  book includes  essays, vignettes,  and  remi­ niscences,  as well as "Mrs. Golightly ..." and  other  stories.  Its  quality is as varied  as   its   forms-sometimes  subtle,    some­ times  sharp,   sometimes so  flat  as  to  be almost   banal,  but   nevertheless  strongly personal and characteristically Wilsonian. For  all  its  unevenness, there   is  in  it,  as was said  of one of Mrs. Wilson's favourite authors, "even   more  to  be  praised   than to  be  pardoned".
First  of  all  there  is  the  incomparable
Mrs.  Golightly  herself,  whose  "first  con­ vention"  has   won   her   so  many  friends  that  they  might  well consider  holding  an annual  convention  of   their   own.   This  engagingly simple-hearted  matron is sup­ ported  by  a  goodly  company  of  female  characters almost  equally  engaging if not
 all   equally   simple-hearted.   Foremost among  these is Mrs.  Forrester, whose un­ controllable impulse  to  play   ducks  and drakes   with   truth  adds   gaiety   to   the political  allegory,  "We  have  to  sit  oppo­ site",  and  seriousness   to  the  light  satire of  "Truth  and   Mrs.  Forrester." "It  is strange", comments Mrs.  Forrester to her niece,   "how   in   the  presence  of  Cousin Max,   or   Miss   Riley,   or   Lee   Lorimer Smith-all  of   them   nice   people-in order   to  preserve  one's   integrity-that is,   truth-one   proceeds   to  act,   which is  to  lie."  Mrs.  Forrester makes  her  first appearance  in   "Haply  the   soul  of  my grandmother", a  story  which, like "Mrs. Golightly  and   the  first  convention", has become  familiar  through frequent  ap­ pearances   in   anthologies.  But   the   new Mrs.  Forrester has  added the  quality  of impish  defensiveness  to   the  original character's powers   of   empathic  percep­ tion,  and  is the  better  for  it.
Like  Mrs.  Forrester, Mrs.  Gormley,  of "A  drink  with  Adolphus", is a  keen  ob­ server of social gambits and  a devastating debunker of social  pretences, though per­ haps   a   more   detached   one,  since   her isolation  in  the  midst  of  a  cocktail-party world  is a physical  rather  than  a psycho­ logical  one.  But  it   would   be  wrong   to give the impression  that  the  tone  of Mrs.  Golightly   and   other   stories  is  predomi­ nantly   sophisticated  and   satirical.  Mrs. Wilson's   characteristic  depth  of   senti­ ment   is  abundantly present;  indeed, in such  stories  as  "From Flores"  and  "The Window"  the    flood   tide   threatens  to carry  the  reader beyond  his  depth. Else­ where,  the  delicate balance  of sentiment and   realism  notable in  Lily's  Story  and Swamp Angel  is successfully  maintained, often   with   the   timely   aid   of  skilfully managed irony.

BOOKS IN  REVIEW



Mrs. Wilson is at her  best  in  the  evo­ cation  of   mood and   atmosphere-the supernatural   ambience   of   "Mr.  Sleep­ walker",  for   example,   though  here   she comes close  to  destroying her  effect, per­ haps  deliberately, in   the  ironic  twist  of the  story's conclusion. Her vivid   presen­ tation of  the  essential detail of  setting is, as   usual,  masterly,   whether   the   scene be Dollarton and the  North Shore mountains,  the   marshes  of   the   Fraser Delta, or  a  corner store  in  Vancouver's east   end.
Less  successful are  the  shorter  pieces, such   as  "God  help the  young fishman", and  such  first-person stories as,  "I  just love  dogs" and "Till Death us do  part". It is something of a paradox that Mrs. Wilson, one  of  the  most  personal  of Canadian  writers, does  not,  even  in  her personal reminiscences, write at her  best in   the   first   person. The "I"  seems   to bring with  it a certain self-conscious awkwardness. The   awkwardness is   es­ pecially apparent  when   she  assumes  the  persona  of   a  well-intentioned   shop-girl or  simpleminded stenographer and writes not    in   her   own   charming   and  highly­ individual   style,   but    like   an   educated woman  trying to  write the  way  a  shop­ girl  might be  expected to  talk.
It is an  indication of its  virtues rather than its  weaknesses to say  that Mrs. Go­ lightly   and  other   stories  makes  the  best of  bed-books, for   this  sort   of   writing is meant  for   leisurely  reading.   It  is  less simple  than  it   seems,   and   there  is   a strength  underlying  its  delicacy. It  is  a book   not   to  be  merely  tasted, nor  to  be chewed, nor  to  be  swallowed whole, but  rather, like   the   best  Chinese  tea,   to  be sipped and  savoured.

 A CANADIAN CLASSIC?
W. 0.  MITCHELL. jake  and  the  Kid.
Macmillan.  r 84  pp.

W.  0. MITCHELL's  stories about Jake and the   kid   began  appearing  in   Maclean's during the  war. A great many Canadians must  have  found  them  then,  as  I did, extremely appealing.  In  the   first   place, the   kid's  father  was   overseas  with    the South  Saskatchewans, and  the   kid,   his mother and Jake, the  elderly and  loqua­ cious  hired man, were  keeping  the home fires  burning. In the  second  place, these  stories were  among the  first  that many of us   who   lived   on   the   prairies  had   ever  read  concerning our   own   people,  our  own    place  and  our   own    time.  When grain  elevators,  gophers,  or   the   sloughs and  bluffs   of   the  "bald-headed  prairie" were   mentioned,  there  was    a   certain thrill   of  recognition. The  same applied to  the  characters who  inhabited Crocus. A  prevalent feeling on  the  subject was, as
I recall-that's us; he's writing  about  us.
Quite a few  years  have gone by. The image of  the  prairie people presented by Mitchell now  seems  like some  blurred recollection  of   childhood,  partially   ap­ pealing because of its  over-simplification, partially  repellent   for   the   same reason. I can   no  longer  be  convinced that even  the  genuinely  ludicrous aspect of  people anywhere   was   ever  as   unreservedly warm  hearted as  the  author of  Jake  and the  Kid  would have  us  believe. Here  is comedy with   no  bite   of  acid   to  cut   the sweet   taste. No  good   person ever   comes to  harm in  Crocus, and the  overwhelm­ ing   majority  of  citizens  are  unquestion­ ably  good. The  few  villains such  as Sam Bottom and  Doc  Toovey  are   truly  vii-

lainous  and   are   always   defeated.  Old Man   Gatenby  embarrasses his  daughter by  telling   his  tall   tales  in  front of  her young   man,  but   the   embarrassment   is only temporary. When  the young man, a collector  of folk lore, spins  the  tallest  tale of  all,  everything is  smooth   once  more. No   one   really   meant  to   be   mean   to anyone.
The emotions expressed in  these stories,   especially   in   the   wartime  ones, now  appear to  contain a  large   measure of   sentimentality.  A   Voice    for   Christ­ mas, a  lump-in-the-throat tale  which  re­ lates  how  the  kid  nearly  misses  hearing
 his  father's  voice   over   the   radio   from England,  almost   seems   to  belong   with such   tear-jerkers  of   the   past   as  The White  Cliffs or  Mrs.  Miniver. Similarly, in   You  Cotta Teeter,  when   the   kid bravely   overcomes  his   grief   at   having lost  his dog  and  manages to  go  through with  his speech  on  behalf  of  the  refugee children, the  heart  of at  least  one  reader was not  quite  as touched as it  may  have been  in days of yore. The argument -a refugee  kid  is  just  like  a  lost  dog-no longer seems   entirely adequate. One tends  to feel  that  a  pertinent fact  about refugees  is that  they  are  not just like lost

dogs. Even  in  the  post-war  stories, which are  generally  better, sentimentality some­ times  obscures   the   truer   quality  of  the humour. The eulogies  to  the  prairie  are cloying-"she's a  blonde-straw blonde  my  blonde -".
A   good    deal   of   humour,   however,
comes  across  as  freshly  as  ever.  Jake   is still   inimitable  as  the   man   who  made Looie Riel say  uncle three times, in English,   French  and   Cree.   His  version of history is a delight (the secret of Wilf Laurier's success, says Jake, was that  he always  teetered when  he make a speech). Miss  Henchbaw and   her  pupils  provide some fine moments-the Christmas con­ cert,   for   example,  when   the   odour   of skunk  overpowers the "frankincents an' meer". I also  like  the  occasion  when  ex­ Indian Moses  Lefthand decides  that  his kid Lazarus, although only a Grade One,  should   present the  bouquet  to  the  Prin­  cess when  the  royal  train stops at Crocus.  The description of  the  auction in  Auc­ tion  Fever  is first-rate.
Had   Mitchell  been  content  with  un­ varnished humour,  his  characters,  how­ ever  simple-minded  or   unequivocally well-intentioned, might  still have emerged
. victorious, or  at  any  rate  emerged.  But in  addition to  the  thick  coating  of  emo­ tionalism, each  tale  has yet  another  layer in  the  form  of a clearly indicated moral.  Be kind  to those less fortunate than  your­ self.  Treat  animals  with  care  and  affec­ tion   and   they   will   not   let   you  down. Cheaters  never  prosper.   School-teachers sometimes have  hearts of gold.  Stick  up for  your  family and  friends. Such maxims  may  be  perfectly  worthy,  as  far  as  they go, but  they  can  hardly  be said  to go far enough.
In one  sense,  I  feel  like  a  traitor  in carping  about  these   stories,   because   I

 am really fond of them. I cannot dismiss them,  for  they  are  a  part  of my life. But I can   no  longer   read   them.   I can  only conclude that  they require a younger audience. I am  not  speaking facetiously. Many books originally written for adults have   been   subsequently  taken   over   by
children. I  can   see   fake   and   the   Kid, as a book for children, becoming a Cana­ dian   classic.

PROVINCIAL HARVEST

Saskatchewan  Writing  1960.  Saskatchewan
Arts  Board,  Regina.

Saskatchewan Writing  1960  is  a  collec­ tion  of  the  prize-winning  short  stories, poems  and  play  submitted to  the  Saskat­ chewan  Arts  Board  literary  competitions in   1959·  The one-act   play,   Like   It   or Not, by Anne  B.  Flavell, concerns Henry VIII  and  his six  wives spending eternity together  in   a   dank    castle   where   they bicker   in   blank   verse.   Into  this   hellish household,  as  a  result  of  a  Satanic error  in   judgment, comes  a  twentieth-century gun  moll,  a  slick  chick  from  New  York, who    before    long   has   Henry    and    his Queen's whirling gaily in a square dance. The verse  form   is  unhappy; the  action lacks    suspense;   the    pace    is   languid. There are,  at  best,  moments that   might well  turn   into  good   stage  fun.
Terry Fenton's story,  "October  Morn­ ing", outhemingways  Hemingway  to  the point   of  boredom.  Three-fourths of  the text  is irrelevant  detail delivered in  stac­ cato   bursts   punctuated  by  the  frequent lighting  of  cigarettes. There is  sensi­ tivity,  psychological  penetration   and compassion  in  James   A.  MacNeil's "No

Time  for   Jerry",  but   the   materials  of this   story   are   trite    (the   mother,   step­ father,  new   baby,   neglected   youngster,  sympathetic  grandpa   routine),  and   the story   is  unfolded   with   annoying  overt­  ness.   A   third   story,   "Dangerous  Mis­ sion",   by  David  G.  Hawkins, had  some ironic   humour  and   satire,   but   neither  finesse  nor  breadth.
The poetry  is in  fact  the  most  impres­ sive  contribution  to  Saskatchewan Writ­ ing   1960.  Luetta   D.   Trehas'  "Burden of   Sleeping"  digs   into   the   sensibilities and   has  some  felicitous phrases.  But  by far   the   most   promising material  comes from  Stan  Thomas in a group  of original  and    truly    contemporary  poems.    His "Dialogue   for   a   Mixed-up  Kid"  and "On   the  World   Past  of  which  we are  so Fond"  are  the  outstanding pieces  in  the collection.                               J. DE  BRUYN


RESOURCES  AND HUMAN  HAPPINESS

RODERICK HA!G-BROWN.  The Living  Land.
Macmillan. $7.50.

SUBTITLED "An  account of the natural resources  of British  Columbia", The  Liv­ ing  Land   by  Roderick  Haig-Brown  was produced   by    the   British   Columbia Natural   Resources    Conference,   which published   its   atlas   in   1956.   This   new production  is   no   doubt  intended  to complement the  earlier one,  but  readers  will  find   the   "Account" of  far   greater value  than   the  atlas.
Mr.   Haig-Brown  has  divided   his  ma­
terial  into  ten  parts.  The first  is the  most important for  any  reader because  it gives the  "frame of  the  land"; it  describes  in words  the   physical   features of  the  pro-
 vmce,   indicates  that   the   author  knows his  history,   to  which   he  gives  often   a geographical  interpretation,  and   merci­ fully,  defines  conservation, "as  much   an act  of  faith   as  an  intellectual  exercise". Basing   his   study   on   the   historical  use of  the   resources,   on   their   geographical distribution,  on   faith   and   on   intellect, Mr.    Haig-Brown   writes   of    forests,   of energy,   of  mines,   of  fish,  of   recreation and  of  agriculture. But  he  considers the greatest   resource   to  be  the  people,  who must   use  their   intellect  to   bring   about the    end    product   of   all    resources   - "human  happiness". He  concludes  that  the   proper    use   of    resources    must    be achieved   through an  educational system which  can  teach  people  that  no man  has a right  to  "damage or destroy  the face  of the earth for short-term gain". Mr.  Haig­ Brown  is a humanist.
This philosophic approach  to  a  living land   is  written in  a  language that   will appeal to the  ordinary concerned citizen by  whom  this  book  was  surely  meant  to be   read.   The  author  has   imposed   his ideas   on   his.  statistics,    and    has   inter­ preted the  resources  of British  Columbia in  a  down-to-earth, decidedly  frank, and  at   times   close-to-revolutionary   manner. Through  kindness,   humour, and   experi­ ence,   but   with   firmness,   he   slashes   at inflexibility  whether in  government circles, among business men or among private citizens.  With   a  frankness which is  telling   but   not   brutal,  and   therefore not  useless, he  displays  the  effects  of  in­ difference to  the  exploitation of  physical resources,  and   in  his  own  way  lays  the blame    squarely  on   restrictive   taxes, greed,  stinginess,  and  lack  of  education. The   brilliant  writing   is  therefore  both  informative and  critical; it  states  a  case forcefully,   but   the   style   precludes the

BOOKS IN  REVIEW



irritating  attributes   of    a   hammering tract.
As   may    be   expected  of   Mr.   Haig­ Brown, time   and time   again he  returns to   the   themes  of  fish,  of   parklands,  of recreation  lands, and  always  and finally  to  the  effects  of  resources and   their des­ truction  or   conservation  on   the   people. As    he    takes    a    reader   through   the  methods  of  extracting ore,   catching sal­  mon,   or   administering  forest  lands, through    the    maze    of   statistics  which never   frighten  - mainly  because  they are  in  words rather than in  numbers and therefore do  not   pockmark  the   page  - he  somehow  leaves   the   impression that in   this   province  of   trees,   of  insects,   of fish  and fowl   and  big  game, of  flowing rivers   and  non-static mountains, in   this land   so   full    of    life,    the    people,  the human  resources, are   the  most  valuable, and  that   without  them    the   other   re­ sources  would  have   no   meaning.   Mr. Haig-Brown is also,  therefore, a  humani­ tarian.
The  Living  Land  is   designed  by
Robert R.  Reid, who   has  illustrated the work  profusely with sketches by British Columbia artists, with  colour  plates, graphs, half-tones, charts, maps, and old engravings;   the    presentation   is   hand­ some    and   well-conceived  to    enhance Robert  Haig-Brown's text.

CREATION BEYOND PERCEPTION

A.   M.    KLEIN.  The   Second  Scroll.  McClelland
&   Stewart.  New   Canadian   Library.  $1.oo.

THERE  ALWAYS  should  be  a  close  rela­
tion    between  a   writer's   perceptions  of
 life  and  his  creation, since   the   latter  is his  realization of  the  former. Thus, there is  much  to  be  said   for   writers like  Sin­ clair  Ross,   Brian Moore and   Mordecai Richler  who   maintain  a  close   relation­ ship    between  what   they   perceive  and what  they   create. And  there is  much to say  against  writers like  W.  0. Mitchell, Hugh MacLennan and  A.  M.  Klein be­ cause their  creations  carry  them  out   of contact  with   their    perceptions.   When this  happens they  begn
anyone does   when carried beyond range of his perceptions: they  pontificate, they preach, they   become pretentious.
The Second   Scroll  is  deliberately, in­
tensively, portentously  Jewish. Conceptu­ ally   and  stylistically it   reaches  back   to the   powerful legend of  the chosen people, the   exodus,  the   exile,   the   sufferings  of the    exile,    the    return   to   the    promised land,  and  attempts  to  relate  the   suffer­ ings  of  the   Jew   in  modern times  (I 91 7-
49)    to   this   great  messianic archetype.
The  significance of  the  sufferings is  that they    become   the    way    in    which  the strange  hand   of   God    lets   man   come round to fulfilment of the covenant. Similarly,  W.   0. Mitchell  in  Who  Has Seen   The  Wind  takes up   an   interplay of  what  he   calls   "the  realities of  birth, hunger, satiety, eternity,  death" and attempts  to   relate  a   prairie  boy's   life to  these   whoppers. Similarly, Hugh Mac­ Lennan  has   sought  to   relate  all  of   his novels  to  the  larger question of  a  Cana­ dian Identity.
The Second   Scroll  is even  more ambi­
tious,    making   Mitchell's   prairie   world and  MacLennan's  Canada  seem    very small    potatoes  indeed.  More,  Klein  is aware  of   his   difficulty and  his   central attempt in  the  novel  is to  make a stylistic adjustment,   responding  to   the    magni-

tude of his subject  by a kind of ironic opulence  in   the   style.  But   it  seems  to me  that   he  becomes  caught in  this  styl­ istic  magnification and  is carried  far  out of   touch    with   his   perceptions.   In   his excellent   introduction,   Professor  M.  W. Steinberg mentions Klein's   "love  of words,  their  sounds  and  associations,  and  his mastery  over  them  .  . . as he daringly  twists  and  shapes  them  to serve  his  pur­  poses."  There  can   be   no  doubt  of  the skill,  but  there  is  much  reason  to feel  in the  often  pointless  and  cloying  language­ play   a  serious  discrepancy  between   the artist's  perceptions and   his  creation. At one   point   the   narrator  chooses   to  bait an  overbearing acquaintance  and  so,

expatiated  upon  the   beauty  of   the   Coca­ Cola    bottle,  curved  and    dusky   like   some Gauguin  painting  of  a  South  Sea  maiden, upon the  purity of  its  contents,  its  ubiquity in  space, its  symbolic  evocations - a  little torchless Statue  of  Liberty. I had   wantonly poetized   thereon,   rhapsodized;  and  the more lyrical I  became ...

But  this deliberate overplay comes dangerously close  to  parody of  the  novel
- "purity . .  . ubiquity .  . .  symbolic evocations  ... wantonly  poetized   ... rhapsodized ... lyrical." So it all is, and, just as a coke bottle  is too inconsequential
to  merit   such   a  style,  so  the   style   be­ comes   an   evocative  substitute  for   per­  ceptions because  the  author has  set  him­  self  a  scene,  an  action   and  an  aspect  of human  history   so  imposingly  large   that  no   man's  capacity  for   perception  can cope.  One   is left  admiring Klein's cour­ age  and  seriousness.

R. M. PATTERSON's newest  book, The Buffalo  Head, sustains  the  impression he gave  us so modestly  in  Dangerous  River. He  is,  indeed,   a  man   of  great   courage and   sensitivity,  endowed  with  imagina­ tion.  With   unusual capacity  he  conveys his deep  feeling  for  the  land  of Canada. It  is  neither   uncommon   nor   a  sign  of our   cultural  immaturity   that    English­ born    Canadians   should   still  do   this effectively.   While   our    most   successful naturalist-artists  were  once  native  Cana­ dians-Roberts,  Seton (a  Canadian from his sixth year) , and  Grove -more recently, Canadian-born  artists and writer   have   been   drawn  to   the   social and  cultural scene.  The best  naturalist­ artists   are   now  frequently  drawn  from outside    the    country:    Roderick   Haig­ Brown,   Arthur   Lismer,   and    Marjorie Pigott,   for   example.  Patterson,  indeed, betrays   little   interest    in   the   Canadian scene  beyond  his  powerful  evocation of the  spirit  of  the  Rockies  and  the  North­ west.
On   the  other   hand,  he  now  tells  us
more  explicitly  something of  himself.  In Dangerous   River   we  were   as  intrigued by his diffidence  as by his descriptions of nature and  adventure. Now,  we  have  a chance  to   know   him   better.  Patterson spent  his earliest  years  in  Ireland, where his father was  editor  of "a  strongly  pro­ English   Dublin  newspaper".   United  in their   adventurous  spirits,   the  two  were divided   by  the  father's  decision  to  don khaki  in  South  Africa.  They   met  again  briefly   twenty-three   years    later,    years during which  Patterson lived in Northern

England   scanning  "the   Distant  Hills" and   reading  of  the   Canada  of   Cham­ plain, Frontenac, and   of  Jack  London. Leaving  school  in I 9 I 7,  Patterson  soon became  an  active  artillery officer and  was almost   immediately   captured  and   con­ fined   in   Silesia,   where   once   more   the hills  beckoned   to  an  adventurous spirit.  The  bonds   of   this   imprisonment  were hardly  burst   when,   after   climbing   the mountains of  the  Continent and  "skim­  ming  the  cream  off  Oxford" for  a good second,  he  was entered as a  probationer in  the Bank  of England. Within months, Patterson  had   fled  this  new  "desert  of stone", striking  out for Canada and  the Peace  River  country.
Yet,  despite  his  success in  homestead­ ing,  hunting, and  trapping, Patterson was not   finally   at   peace    (he   was  never   at rest)   until  he returned to  the  mountains. In  the  foothills   of  the  Rockies,  west  of High River, Alberta, on  the eastern  slope of  the  Continental  Divide,  he  purchased the  Buffalo  Head  ranch,  his  home  from the  early  thirties  until  after   World   War II. The account of  his life as a rancher is witty,  filled   with  interesting details  and colour   drawn  from   a  close  observation of  men  and   of  animals. But  this  is  not enough  to give the  book its special  value.
The Buffalo  was not a ranch  alone:  it was  an  advance  base  for  grand  adven­ ture  and  discovery  in  a wild  and  beauti­ ful   mountain  country.  Perhaps   no  one since  Frank Smythe (of whom  Patterson is  obviously   an  admirer)  has  succeeded  so well  in  describing the  peculiar attrac­ tion  of  the  mountains.  Even  the  names  of his new  surroundings  were  poetic  and  seductive:  the  Valley  of  the  Elk,  Misty Mountain,  the   Pass  in   the  Clouds,   the mountain meadow of  Nyahe-ya-nibi, the Warship.

74
 Those distant mountains had  a way of beckoning to  you,   and it  was  so  easy  just to   saddle  a   couple  of   horses   and   hit   the trail ...

On   the  trail,  Patterson takes  you  to  the heart of  the  mountains and  into  an adventure of  the  spirit as  well  as of  the body.  Stories  of drama, courage, peril, resourcefulness are  there  to stir  the heart. But   the   intriguing  quality  of  the   book lies  in   the   contrast  between   such   raw tales and  the extraordinarily vivid and sensitive   description  of  sylvan  and   pas­ toral  scenes-in  the  mountain  meadows with  their   carpets of  alpine  flowers  and in  gazing  down  the  long vistas of an  un­ touched mountain  world.
Patterson reminds one  of  another Canadian romanticist and  adventurer: Captain  Joshua  Slocum,  the   writer   of that   little  classic,  Sailing  Alone  Around the  World. They   share  a  gift  for  coura­ geous  discovery,  for blunt  virile narrative, and  for poetic  description. Like Slocum's, Patterson's  style   in   uneven,   sometimes  awkward,  but   at   its   best  it   is  precise, graphic and   moving.   With  Slocum,   too, Patterson  can   impart  the   force   of  his preoccupation with  the lonely  places and with  an  independent  spirit.

I  had   found, close   to  home,  the   true   un­ touched  wilderness of  the   wild  hills.  That, in  times   of  stress,  was  what held   me  there on  the  Buffalo Head. That  was  what  made a  settled  life   possible   for   one   whose   con­  ception  of  the   perfect  home was  a  camp.

The   tragic climax   of  Patterson's story of his love for these mountains was the Phillips    fire   of   1936,   which    engulfed much   of   his   wild   retreat.  The   drama and  pathos in his description of this wholesale   destruction  might  have  made a  bitter   ending to  his  saga.  Instead, the book  ends  on  a note  of hope,  great cour­ age,  and   adventure with  a  tale  of  their

final  departure from   their   beloved  foot­ hills  country. One   October  day  in   the forties,  Patterson and  his  wife,  with  five horses,   began    a   daring   journey   across the  snow-filled  passes of  the  Rockies  and  the  Continental Divide  to  the  Columbia Valley   in   British   Columbia.  Although their   trail   did   not  end   there,   it  was  a typical   outing  for   Patterson,   climaxed characteristically  by  a  cup  of  tea  in  the hotel  at  Radium  Hot  Springs.

ada  and  the  Search   for Peace.  Macmillan.

CANADA's EXTREME poverty  in  "the liter­ ature of politics" is the lament of  the edi­ torial   in  Canadian Literature, Autumn, Ig6I;  with few   exceptions   (Goldwin Smith, Henri Bourassa, the Abbe  Groulx, and   F.  H.  Underhill are  cited)  writers  on  politics  in  this  country  have  been  dis­ tinguished  for   "the   suetty   texture"  of their   prose  and   their   "almost  obsessive tendency ... to deal  in abstractions ...." Who   can   deny   that  these  strictures are well-founded? But  here is another excep­ tion.  Professor  Eayrs'  discussion  of Can­ ada's relations with other political entities  of varying degrees  of solidity-the U.N.,  N.A.T.O.,   the  Commonwealth-be­ longs   to   the   literature  of   politics.   His prose   is   anything  but   "suetty" and   he abjures  abstractions in  a  grim   determi­ nation   to   look    unflinchingly at  the  horrors  of  the  nuclear age.
Some   of  the   material  in  this  volume
has  been  published  before   or  presented
 in  public  addresses  between   the  autumn of   I957   and   the   spring   of   Ig6o,   but much  of it  is new.  In  the  latter category there  is an interesting essay on Canadian­ Soviet   relations  in   the  I g 20's,   based largely  on  the   Mackenzie  King   papers,  which   historians  will  probably  find  the most  permanently  valuable  part   of  the book.  The  attention  of  current  readers  will  be  focussed  on  the  chapters dealing  with  Canada's  role  in  a  world   distress­ ingly different from  the familiar one in which  Canadians, often  erroneously, saw their  country as the  reconciler of  Anglo­ American  interests, and  the  worst  night­ mare  for  our  minister of  external affairs  was  one   "wherein   hinges   broke,   linch pins   snaped, and   bridges   fell   into   the sea".  One  of  the  merits   of  this  book  is that   it  makes   so   abundantly  clear   the irrelevance  of  the  cliches   of  that   older era in the  uncharted world of the balance of  terror.
Professor Eayrs  rejects any policy of disengagement, and  Canadian unilateral disarmers   and   neutralists  will  find  here a forceful  presentation of  the  arguments they must  answer  if they  are  to win Canadians  to  their   cause.   In   Professor Eayrs' view the devil in most Canadian discussion   of   defence  policy   is  a   pre­ occupation with  Canadian-American re­ lations  which  obscures  the  fact  that  it is the  Soviet  Union, not  the  United States,  which   is   our   chief   problem;  and   the  primary fact  about Soviet  policy, he con­ tends,  is  that   it  is  aimed   at   the  domi­ nation of the world,  by force  if necessary. Add  to  this  Canada's unique  geographi­ cal  position  on  the  northern  approaches from   Russia   to  the   United  States,   plus the  conviction   that   the  Great  Deterrent really  deters,  and  our  course  is clear: we have  no alternative  but to  do everything

in our power to strengthen the defence system centred in the United States. In practical  terms  this  means  that  Canada must  open  her territory and  territorial waters   to  American   retaliatory  missiles and   anti-missile defences  and  must  take civil  defence seriously.  Yet  armed  might is not  our  sole  weapon; improved  politi­ cal  communication with  the  Communist world  must  be seen  as part of  the  policy of   deterrence. Thus  Professor  Eayrs argues  convincingly for  Canadian recog­ nition  of  Communist  China  and  against American policy  in  Cuba.
One    question  is  passed   over   rather lightly: is it obvious, as Professor Eayrs suggests,  that   there  is no practical  possi­ bility  of  limiting the  "nuclear  club"  and  that  the  rejection of  nuclear  weapons  by Canada would  be of no effect  whatever? Perhaps the  logic of  realpolitik  has some limitations?

DOUBLE  FACES OF KINGS

DARYL HINE.  The  Devil's  Picture Book.
Abelard-Schuman.

EvEN   THE   TITLE  IMAGE of  The  Devil's Picture  Book, by Daryl  Hine,  is multiple and  extending. An  old  name  for  playing cards,  it  recalls  the  double  faces of kings, queen,  knaves-all   mirrored,  all   right side up  and  upside  down,  no matter how they  are  held.  It recalls  the  older  names for  cards-the  King's Book, le livre  des quatre  rois-and the reproving mockery, in   this   Presbyterian  variant,  which   we now mock.  The title  suggests, then, dual­ ity,   diversion  and   moral   judgment,  all commented on  by  contemporary detach-
 ment    and    also   by   the    continuity   of human memory. More  obviously,  The Devil's  Picture  Book  is a demonic primer. Its  poems  are  short,  short-lined, rhymed, strongly   related  in   theme.  In   a   tight, closely  worked   book  about  the  darkness out  of  and  into  which  man  is led,  even pictures  of   terrible  division   or   cancel­ lation   are  wry, ordered,  intelligent.
The  title   poem   (which is  put   at   the
end)  makes a  connection between "poetry's  demonic  tongue" and   wit.  In that  poem  "the Old  Instructor tries I To
teach  a  patient girl  to  name  I The senti­
mental verities." She  will not  learn. "She does  not  see, she says, what  life I Sharp­ ness has  apart from  knife, I Nor  why de­ parture spells  return."  While  these  two, in   stale   and   endless   argument,  dispute
"the  terror  of   the    verb   To    Be,"   all around them  the  objects from  which  one might  begin  to learn  "loom  I Crude with
incredulity." It is  because  of  the  failure of   "our    common  education"   that    we have  been  "stung I By  poetry's demonic
tongue: I Where  faith  was  feeling,   wit prevailed."
In this  comment  on  faith as  nothing but  feeling, on  wit  as stronger than  such a  faith   but  also  thin,  also  partial, there is a  recollection of the  first  poems  in  the book.  "The Suitor" mocks  not  only  the "ill-controlled", "unashamed", "absurd" passion   of   his   rival   but   also   his   own "facile and articulate" song. "The Double-Goer"  (image of  death in  life) is  "so   split   and   halved  and   twain" in every  part   that   he  is confused in  object and   in  aim;  nevertheless, this  is  man's real  condition. The  one-sailed ship  is bound   to  be  "wrecked  and   lost  away", since   the   sea   on   which   it   tosses  is  a divided  sea.
Some  of  the  richest  images  of  duality

BOOKS IN  REVIEW



in  this  Devil's  Picture Book  are  its kings and   queens:  Osiris,  Orpheus,  Dionysus, Proserpina,  Circe-figures   of  dismem­ berment  and   the   dark   journey.    Torn, silenced,   exiled,   they   are   also   reborn, singing,   sown   like   seed,   and    in   these poems  stand   fully  paradoxical. The  de­ scent   into   the   underworlds   serves   the purposes  of life;  the  dismembered  god  is the  god  of  fertility;  but   the   torn   body always  bleeds  and  the  queen of  darkness
is "far fallen  from  the  natural air I And
possibility  of  spring." There are  two poems  of  Osiris:  "Osiris Dismembered" and  "Osiris Remembered." The first one ends,  "Can you  tell  me,  with  your  torn­
out   tongue,  I Is   it   light   you   look   for
under the  horizon?" and   the  second  be­ gins,  "The form  of  myth  is like  the  life of   dream, I Nothing  occurs   save   with significance." Departure   does   spell   re­
turn,   but  the  return,  "begemmed and thunderous", is "Fatal with  the wheels' empurpled noise."
These are  intelligent and  passionate poems, often  wry, sometimes gay and ele­ gant, sometimes, as in  "The  Destruction of  Sodom", informed by  wit.  ("All  love
deserves  the  epitaph 'Perversion', I Being
unnaturally concerned, like physics, with foreign   bodies, I Inseparable  from   their uses  and   abuses.")  They  are   difficult.
There are  some  uncertainties of  tone  or rhythm. But  the  intensity and   power  of the  book  are  remarkable. This  is an important  work.

 ESSENCE OF CITY

Written   and  edited   by  Pierre   Berton;  photo­ graphed   by  Henri Rossier.  The  New  City.  Macmillan. $7.50.

THIS  "No-BooK"  (Time   Magazine's word   for   reprints,  anthologies, picture books, and  other publisher's pap)   misses the point of every  big city in general, and Toronto in particular. The pictures  seem to  say  that   everything  that   happens in Toronto happens at  the  C.N.E., the  race track  and  in  the  darker crevices  of Jarvis Street's  sin  strip.   And   what   is  it   that happens there?   Nothing very interesting. Nevertheless,  the  poor  photography  not­ withstanding,  if  the   eight   essays  which make   up  the   text   (a  total   of  no  more  than  fifty normal pages) , together with  a few of  the  better   photographs,  had  been published   in  eight   separate  installments of  a   national  Sunday   supplement,  the series might   have  won  some  distinction; since,  as  a  journalistic  record   of  a  con­ temporary event-the metamorphosis of
a  big city-it  has  a  certain value.  Like the  briefcases  and   electric   razors  which Berton   predicts  will  be  studied  by  the future  arch<rologists  of  Don   Mills,  this book  will  be  a  must  for  lecturers  speak­ ing  to  twenty-first  century  ladies'  clubs. The  present-day historian, sociologist and  city  planner  will  find  little  to  help  him understand  any   better  the    complex organism   of  the  new  city,  but  he  might be  moved  to  consult   the  author further about   some   of   his   intriguing  undocu­ mented   references  and   half-told  anec­  dotes.
The    information  that    is   offered    is strictly  for the  non.-discriminating reader. For instance, in the section  called  "The Gilded  Ghetto," we read: "But,  only in Forest   Hill,   could   you   have   a  Jewish

BOOKS IN REVIEW



high  school  student  write  an  article  for the school paper on Jewish anti-Gentilism and have it rejected by a Gentile teacher."  This ambiguous morass of dubious human motivation, hopelessly entangled, is thus  deftly  leapt  over  with a   grin   which    looks   something    like   a sneer,  but  we can't tell which.
The  author  chides   the   Old   Toron­ tonian as  a  crusty,  snobbish,  but  faintly  superior  person,    who   frets   about    the immigrants, the  rise  of  apartment house living  and  good  restaurants, with  all that  this  implies   in   terms   of  instability  and the  declasse activity  of "eating out". He tells  us that  the  new  immigrants are  the ones  who  are  not   only  facing   the  new city,  but  encouraging its growth, making something of  it,  and   loving  it  in  a  way that   no  Old  Torontonian ever  did.
Yet,  neither  the   writer   nor  the  illus­ trator discover  for  us  the  essence  of  big city  Toronto, the  vitality  of its shopping streets,  its eleg,ant  if not  beautiful newer and  older   architecture,   such    as   its picturesque  Romanesque Revival    (not "Gothic")   City Hall, its  urbane row houses  on  tree-lined  streets,  shabby   but dignified,  or  the  coldly  aristocratic Neo­ Classic   fac;ades  of  its  financial   district. Berton   tells  us  how   many   art   galleries and   museums  we   can   find   there,   but gives  no  hint   of  the  kind  of  cosmopoli­ tanism   that   this  could   imply.  The  uni­ versity  is hardly mentioned, let  alone  its life  and  influence.
One  suspects  that, in  spite  of  protests to  the  contrary, both  writer  and  photo­ grapher still  find  Toronto, as  the  writer admits he found it  some years  ago, "un­ utterably dull."

SHORT  REVIEW

Two  NEW BOOKS dealing  with   special periods  of Canadian history add to the growing  list   of   interpretations  of   our past.  In   From  Sea  to  Sea   (Doubleday,
$6.oo), Professor   W.  G.  Hardy gives  a
frankly  popular  account  of  the  forging of  a  united Canada  between   I85o  and I g 10;   it  is  a  lively,  pleasantly  opinion­ ated    book,  full   of  the   kind   of   curious  detail that  makes  history  readable to  the layman, but  judicious  also  in  its  broader judgments. In  The  Founding  of Canada (Progress  Books,   paper  $3.oo, cloth
$5.00),  Stanley B.  Ryerson   presents   "a Marxist interpretation  of  Canadian  his­ tory",  taking   us  from   the   days  of   the trilobites to  1815.  The  viewpoint  follows the  line  for  the  Ig6o's; and  the  accepted authorities  are   well   quoted.  Lenin   ap­  pears  in  the  index  as often  as  Frontenac and   Marx more  often  than  Mackenzie.

LOWRY SUPPLEMENT



33·  HALDANE, CHARLOTTE.  I  Bring  Not  Peace.
London,  Chatto  &   Windus,  June   1932. The character James Dowd, in  this  novel, has   many  similarities  with    the   Malcolm Lowry    of   the    Ultramarine period. The book  is dedicated to  Malcolm Lowry,  and
3   lyrics    (ICr26-8)   sung  by   Dowd    are
credited  by   the    author  to   Lowry. The climactic episode is similar to one  which underlines  the    plot    of   Lowry's   unpub­ lished   novel,  "October Ferry to  Gabriola" (IGr).
